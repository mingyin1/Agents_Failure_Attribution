(provide the answer in percentage)\n\n\nTo answer this request we have assembled the following team:\n\nAssistant: A helpful and general-purpose AI assistant that has strong language skills, Python skills, and Linux command line skills.\nComputerTerminal: A computer terminal that performs no other action than running Python scripts (provided to it quoted in ```python code blocks), or sh shell scripts (provided to it quoted in ```sh code blocks)\nFileSurfer: An agent that can handle local files.\nWebSurfer: A helpful assistant with access to a web browser. Ask them to perform web searches, open pages, and interact with content (e.g., clicking links, scrolling the viewport, etc., filling in form fields, etc.) It can also summarize the entire page, or answer questions based on the content of the page. It can also be asked to sleep and wait for pages to load, in cases where the pages seem to be taking a while to load.\n\n\n\nHere is an initial fact sheet to consider:\n\n1. GIVEN OR VERIFIED FACTS\n- The request asks for the likelihood of hitting a rainy day (at least 0.5mm of precipitation) in Seattle during the first week of September based on recent years (2020-2023).\n\n2. FACTS TO LOOK UP\n- Historical weather data for Seattle from 2020 to 2023 for the first week of September, which can be found on authoritative sources such as the National Weather Service (NWS), Weather.com, or NOAA (National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration).\n\n3. FACTS TO DERIVE\n- The probability (in percentage) of having at least one rainy day (with at least 0.5mm of precipitation) during the first week of September in Seattle, based on the historical data.\n\n4. EDUCATED GUESSES\n- Seattle is known for its rainy climate, but early September tends to be drier than other parts of the year. From general knowledge, an educated guess might suggest a moderate chance of rain, but specific data is required for accuracy.\n\n\nHere is the plan to follow as best as possible:\n\nHere is the plan:\n\n1. **WebSurfer**:\n    - Search for historical weather data for Seattle for the first week of September from 2020 to 2023.\n    - Fetch the number of rainy days (with at least 0.5mm of precipitation) during that period each year.\n\n2. **Assistant**:\n    - Once the data is gathered by WebSurfer, process the data to determine the likelihood (in percentage) of having at least one rainy day during the first week of September.\n\n3. **Assistant**:\n    - Communicate the final result to the user.\n\nLet's begin by asking WebSurfer to search for the historical weather data.\n\n/usr/local/lib/python3.11/site-packages/autogen_magentic_one/agents/orchestrator.py:216: UserWarning: Resolved model mismatch: gpt-4o-2024-08-06 != gpt-4o-2024-05-13.
