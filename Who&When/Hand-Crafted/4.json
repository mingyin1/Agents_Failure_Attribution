Ask them to perform web searches, open pages, and interact with content (e.g., clicking links, scrolling the viewport, etc., filling in form fields, etc.) It can also summarize the entire page, or answer questions based on the content of the page. It can also be asked to sleep and wait for pages to load, in cases where the pages seem to be taking a while to load.\n\n\n\nHere is an initial fact sheet to consider:\n\n1. GIVEN OR VERIFIED FACTS\n- The request concerns hiking trails to waterfalls in Yosemite National Park.\n- The trails must have more than 1,000 reviews on TripAdvisor.\n- The trails need to be fully accessible to wheelchairs as recommended by at least three different people.\n- The trails are rated at 4.5/5 or more on average.\n\n2. FACTS TO LOOK UP\n- Specific names of popular hiking trails to waterfalls in Yosemite National Park.\n- Ratings of these trails on TripAdvisor.\n- Number of reviews for these trails on TripAdvisor.\n- Recommendations and accessibility comments from users, particularly regarding wheelchair accessibility.\n\n3. FACTS TO DERIVE\n- The correlation between the number of reviews and the ratings to verify high popularity and overall satisfaction.\n- Aggregation of user reviews to confirm wheelchair accessibility if explicitly stated by at least three different users.\n\n4. EDUCATED GUESSES\n- Yosemite Falls Trail might be a candidate due to its popularity.\n- Bridalveil Fall Trail may also be considered, as it is known to be relatively short and accessible.\n- Lower Yosemite Fall Trail is likely to be highly rated and accessible, with verified recommendations on accessibility.\n\n\nHere is the plan to follow as best as possible:\n\nHere is a short bullet-point plan for addressing the original request:\n\n1. **WebSurfer**:\n    - Search for popular hiking trails to waterfalls in Yosemite National Park with more than 1,000 reviews on TripAdvisor.\n    - Verify the average rating for each of these trails to ensure they are 4.5/5 or higher.\n    - Check user reviews on TripAdvisor specifically for comments about wheelchair accessibility, and identify if at least three different users have recommended it to be fully accessible to wheelchairs.\n    - Summarize findings for each trail based on the gathered information.\n\n2. **Assistant**:\n    - Review the summary provided by WebSurfer and consolidate the information.\n    - Ensure all criteria (more than 1,000 reviews, 4.5/5 rating, recommended by at least three different users for wheelchair accessibility) are met.\n    - Present the final list of trails that match the criteria along with evidence supporting their inclusion.\n\nThis plan involves primarily using WebSurfer to find and confirm the required information, and the Assistant to compile and verify the data.\n\n/usr/local/lib/python3.11/site-packages/autogen_magentic_one/agents/orchestrator.py:216: UserWarning: Resolved model mismatch: gpt-4o-2024-08-06 != gpt-4o-2024-05-13.
