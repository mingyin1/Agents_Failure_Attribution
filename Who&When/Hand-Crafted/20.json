There was a similar burst-1 diagram in another paper from one of the same authors about fast radio bursts back in July 2020, but I can't recall what the difference in seconds in the measured time span was. How many more seconds did one measure than the other? Just give the number.\n\n\nTo answer this request we have assembled the following team:\n\nAssistant: A helpful and general-purpose AI assistant that has strong language skills, Python skills, and Linux command line skills.\nComputerTerminal: A computer terminal that performs no other action than running Python scripts (provided to it quoted in ```python code blocks), or sh shell scripts (provided to it quoted in ```sh code blocks)\nFileSurfer: An agent that can handle local files.\nWebSurfer: A helpful assistant with access to a web browser. Ask them to perform web searches, open pages, and interact with content (e.g., clicking links, scrolling the viewport, etc., filling in form fields, etc.) It can also summarize the entire page, or answer questions based on the content of the page. It can also be asked to sleep and wait for pages to load, in cases where the pages seem to be taking a while to load.\n\n\n\nHere is an initial fact sheet to consider:\n\n1. GIVEN OR VERIFIED FACTS\n- Paper about multiwavelength observations of fast radio bursts in March 2021 on Arxiv.\n- Diagram of an X-ray time profile in the March 2021 paper.\n- Another paper by one of the same authors about fast radio bursts in July 2020.\n- Similar burst-1 diagram in the July 2020 paper.\n\n2. FACTS TO LOOK UP\n- Specific measurement details of the time span in seconds in both the March 2021 and July 2020 papers.\n- Locations of the specific papers on Arxiv.\n\n3. FACTS TO DERIVE\n- The difference in seconds between the measured time spans of the diagrams in the two papers.\n\n4. EDUCATED GUESSES\n- The papers can likely be found by searching for fast radio bursts and the respective publication months (March 2021 and July 2020) on Arxiv.\n\n\nHere is the plan to follow as best as possible:\n\nHere is the plan for addressing the original request:\n\n1. **WebSurfer:**\n   - Search for the paper titled \"multiwavelength observations of fast radio bursts\" on Arxiv published in March 2021.\n   - Search for another paper on fast radio bursts by the same author(s) published in July 2020.\n   - Retrieve specific details of the measurement time span in seconds for the X-ray time profile diagrams in both papers.\n\n2. **Assistant:**\n   - Calculate the difference in seconds between the measured time spans once the data is retrieved.\n\nPlan execution steps:\n1. WebSurfer will find and extract the relevant time span information from both papers.\n2. The Assistant will receive the data and compute the difference in seconds between the two measurements.\n\nLet's start by asking WebSurfer to find the March 2021 paper on Arxiv.\n\n/usr/local/lib/python3.11/site-packages/autogen_magentic_one/agents/orchestrator.py:216: UserWarning: Resolved model mismatch: gpt-4o-2024-08-06 != gpt-4o-2024-05-13.

Though several models have been proposed to explain the observed data, none is able to explain alone the variety of events so far recorded. The leading models consider magnetars as potential FRB sources. The recent detection of FRBs from the galactic magnetar SGR J1935+2154 seems to support them. Still, emission duration and energetic budget challenge all these models. Like for other classes of objects initially detected in a single band, it appeared clear that any solution to the FRB enigma could only come from a coordinated observational and theoretical effort in an as wide as possible energy band. In particular, the detection and localisation of optical/NIR and/or high-energy counterparts seemed an unavoidable starting point that could shed light on the FRB physics. Multiwavelength (MWL) search campaigns were conducted for several FRBs, in particular for repeaters. Here we summarize the observational and theoretical results and the perspectives in view of the several new sources accurately localised that will likely be identified by various radio facilities worldwide. We conclude that more dedicated MWL campaigns sensitive to the millisecond--minute timescale transients are needed to address the various aspects involved in the identification of FRB counterparts. Dedicated instrumentation could be one of the key points in this respect. In the optical/NIR band, fast photometry looks to be the only viable strategy. Additionally, small/medium size radiotelescopes co-pointing higher energies telescopes look a very interesting and cheap complementary observational strategy.\n\nComments:   44 pages, 8 figures, Accepted for publication on Universe\nSubjects:   High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE)\nJournal reference:   Universe 2021, 7, 76\nDOI:   10.3390/universe7030076\nCite as:  arXiv:2103.07786 [astro-ph.HE]\n(or arXiv:2103.07786v2 [astro-ph.HE] for this version)\n\nBibliographic data\n[Enable Bibex(What is Bibex?)]\nSubmission history\nFrom: Luciano Nicastro Dr. [view email]\n[v1] Sat, 13 Mar 2021 20:39:49 GMT (14577kb,D)\n[v2] Thu, 25 Mar 2021 10:44:14 GMT (11956kb,D)\n\nWhich authors of this paper are endorsers? | Disable MathJax (What is MathJax?)\n\n[Help | Advanced search]\nDownload:\nPDF\nOther formats\n\nCurrent browse context:\nastro-ph.HE\n[< prev | next >]\nnew | recent | 2103\n\nChange to browse by:\nastro-ph\n\nReferences & Citations\nINSPIRE HEP (refers to | cited by) \nNASA ADS\n\nExport citation\nGoogle Scholar\n\nBookmark (what is this?) \n\nWe gratefully acknowledge support from the Simons Foundation and member institutions.\n<Image>",

There was a similar burst-1 diagram in another paper from one of the same authors about fast radio bursts back in July 2020, but I can't recall what the difference in seconds in the measured time span was. How many more seconds did one measure than the other? Just give the number.\n\n\nTo answer this request we have assembled the following team:\n\nAssistant: A helpful and general-purpose AI assistant that has strong language skills, Python skills, and Linux command line skills.\nComputerTerminal: A computer terminal that performs no other action than running Python scripts (provided to it quoted in ```python code blocks), or sh shell scripts (provided to it quoted in ```sh code blocks)\nFileSurfer: An agent that can handle local files.\nWebSurfer: A helpful assistant with access to a web browser. Ask them to perform web searches, open pages, and interact with content (e.g., clicking links, scrolling the viewport, etc., filling in form fields, etc.) It can also summarize the entire page, or answer questions based on the content of the page. It can also be asked to sleep and wait for pages to load, in cases where the pages seem to be taking a while to load.\n\n\n\nHere is an initial fact sheet to consider:\n\nHere is the updated fact sheet:\n\n1. GIVEN OR VERIFIED FACTS\n- Paper about multiwavelength observations of fast radio bursts in March 2021 on Arxiv (arxiv:2103.07786).\n- Diagram of an X-ray time profile in the March 2021 paper.\n- Another paper by one of the same authors about fast radio bursts in July 2020.\n- Similar burst-1 diagram in the July 2020 paper.\n- We have located and attempted to download both papers.\n\n2. FACTS TO LOOK UP\n- Specific measurement details of the time span in seconds in both the March 2021 and July 2020 papers.\n- Precise locations or direct links to both papers on Arxiv (particularly the July 2020 paper).\n\n3. FACTS TO DERIVE\n- The difference in seconds between the measured time spans of the diagrams in the two papers.\n\n4. EDUCATED GUESSES\n- Given that the March 2021 paper has already been located, it is likely the July 2020 paper can be found similarly by searching for the same author's work on fast radio bursts during that period.\n- The diagrams might be in the results or methods sections, where time profiles and measurements are typically discussed in such research papers.\n- Given the nature of these measurements, the time spans could reasonably vary by up to a few seconds due to differing observational conditions and methods.\n\nWe need to locate the full text of both the March 2021 and July 2020 papers' PDFs, examine them for the X-ray time profile diagrams, and extract the measurement time spans in seconds.\n\n\nHere is the plan to follow as best as possible:\n\n## Problem Explanation\n\n**Root Cause:**\n- The primary issue encountered was difficulty in accessing and extracting the required X-ray time profile measurement data from the specific sections of the downloaded papers. Additionally, there was an error (404) encountered when attempting to access the July 2020 paper.\n\n## Plan to Overcome Prior Challenges\n\n### Preparation and Verification\n1. **WebSurfer:**\n   - Confirm and download the correct March 2021 paper from the given Arxiv link. Ensure the PDF is complete and accessible.\n   - Locate and download the correct July 2020 paper on Arxiv. Verify the download to avoid potential 404 errors.\n\n2. **FileSurfer:**\n   - Extract the downloaded PDFs for the March 2021 and July 2020 papers and navigate to the relevant sections containing the X-ray time profile diagrams.\n\n### Data Extraction and Comparison\n3. **Assistant & FileSurfer:**\n   - Open the verified PDFs and identify the X-ray time profile diagrams.\n   - Extract measurement time spans in seconds from the X-ray time profile diagrams in both papers.\n\n### Final Computation\n4. **Assistant:** \n   - Compute and report the difference in the measured time spans between the two papers once the data is retrieved.\n\n### Backup Steps\n5. **Assistant & WebSurfer:**\n   - If issues persist, use alternate methods such as searching for direct citations or specific sections mentioning time spans in the summaries/abstracts.\n\nBy following this plan, we can mitigate the previous challenges and ensure accurate extraction and comparison of the required data.",

Many FRB models predict prompt multiwavelength counterparts, which can be used to refine our knowledge of these fundamentals of the FRB phenomenon. However, several previous targeted searches for prompt FRB counterparts have yielded no detections and have additionally not reached sufficient sensitivity with respect to the predictions. In this work, we demonstrate a technique to estimate the ratio, \\u03b7, between the energy outputs of FRB counterparts at various wavelengths and the radio-wavelength emission. Our technique combines the fluence distribution of the FRB population with results from several wide-field blind surveys for fast transients from the optical to the TeV bands. We present constraints on \\u03b7 that improve upon previous observations even in the case where all unclassified transient events in existing surveys are FRB counterparts. In some scenarios for the FRB engine and emission mechanism, we find that FRB counterparts should have already been detected, thus demonstrating that our technique can successfully test predictions for \\u03b7. However, it is possible that FRB counterparts are lurking among catalogs of unclassified transient events. Although our technique is robust to the present uncertainty in the FRB fluence distribution, its ultimate application to accurately estimate or bound \\u03b7 will require the careful analysis of all candidate fast transient events in multiwavelength survey data sets.\",\n            \"articleBody\": \"1. IntroductionFast radio bursts (FRBs) are short (\\u223cms) and luminous (\\u223c1042  erg s\\u22121) radio pulses detected at extragalactic distances. There have been nearly a hundred FRBs reported (Petroff et al. 2016), and the estimated rate is \\\\sim {10}^{3}\\\\,{\\\\mathrm{sky}}^{-1}\\\\,{\\\\mathrm{day}}^{-1} (Bhandari et al. 2018). Five FRB sources have been directly associated with host galaxies, revealing a range of galaxy classes and source environments (Chatterjee et al. 2017; Bannister et al. 2019; Prochaska et al. 2019; Ravi et al. 2019; Marcote et al. 2020). Repeat bursts have been observed from 20 FRB sources (Spitler et al. 2016; CHIME/FRB Collaboration et al. 2019a, 2019b; Kumar et al. 2019; Fonseca et al. 2020), indicating that at least some FRBs originate from noncatastrophic events (see also Ravi 2019). The exact FRB emission mechanism(s) and engine(s) remain elusive.The high brightness temperatures (\\u223c1035 K) of FRBs require a coherent emission process. Although several astrophysical coherent emission mechanisms are identified with Galactic sources (Melrose 2017), these mechanisms encounter difficulties with the energy scales of FRBs. Two classes of mechanisms have been proposed for FRBs (although see, e.g., Lyubarsky 2020): synchrotron masers (e.g., Lyubarsky  2014; Beloborodov 2017; Ghisellini 2017; Waxman 2017; Metzger et al. 2019) and coherent curvature radiation (e.g., Cordes & Wasserman 2016; Kumar et al. 2017). Synchrotron masers require a population inversion in the emitting lepton energy and pitch-angle distribution. This is generally thought to be possible in an ultrarelativistic (bulk Lorentz factor \\u0393 \\u226b 1) radiative shock driven into a significantly magnetized plasma (magnetization parameter \\u03c3 \\u2273 10\\u22123); the shock is mediated by Larmor-rotating charges, which results in the population inversion within the shock. The curvature-radiation mechanism instead scales ideas for the generation of pulsar radio emission to FRB energy scales, invoking coherently radiating bunches of relativistic (\\u0393 \\u223c 30) leptons accelerated by magnetic reconnection events. These radiation processes are discussed in the context of several progenitor models. The majority of these models involve highly magnetized neutron stars/magnetars, because the short durations and high luminosities of FRBs require compact, active engines with large energy budgets and emission-region field strengths of \\u22731010 G.Several classes of FRB models (emission mechanism and/or engine) predict prompt multiwavelength counterparts and specify the ratio between the energy emitted by the counterpart and by the FRB. Synchrotron masers initiated by ultrarelativistic shocks are accompanied by synchrotron emission from fast-cooling shock-heated electrons that cascade through the \\u03b3-ray and X-ray bands on subsecond timescales, or perhaps through the optical/near-infrared (NIR) bands in the case of an electron\\u2013positron plasma upstream of the shock (Metzger et al. 2019). Specific luminosities comparable to or greater than the FRB luminosities are predicted for the higher-energy emission. Additionally, although the curvature-radiation mechanism does not naturally produce multiwavelength emission, the mechanism may be triggered by events that do radiate across the electromagnetic spectrum (e.g., the cosmic comb model; Zhang 2017).We define the ratio between the energy radiated by an FRB event in a given electromagnetic band and in the radio band as\\\\begin{eqnarray}&&\\\\eta ({\\\\nu }_{c})=\\\\displaystyle \\\\frac{{F}_{\\\\mathrm{Band}}}{{F}_{\\\\mathrm{Radio}}}\\\\approx \\\\displaystyle \\\\frac{{\\\\nu }_{1,\\\\mathrm{Band}}\\\\cdot {F}_{\\\\nu ,\\\\mathrm{Band}}}{{\\\\nu }_{1,\\\\mathrm{Radio}}\\\\cdot {F}_{\\\\nu \\\\mathrm{Radio}}}.\\\\end{eqnarray}     \\\\tag{     1     }    Here, \\u03bdc is the central frequency of the band of interest, FRadio and FBand are the band-integrated fluences in the band of interest and the radio band, respectively, {F}_{\\\\nu ,\\\\mathrm{Radio}} and {F}_{\\\\nu ,\\\\mathrm{Band}} are the specific fluences, and {\\\\nu }_{1,\\\\mathrm{Band}} and {\\\\nu }_{1,\\\\mathrm{Radio}} are the lower-frequency bounds of these two bands. The commonly made approximation in the second step (Gehrels 1997) assumes that the bands span natural-logarithmic frequency intervals, but is accurate in general when the specific fluence scales as F\\u03bd \\u221d \\u03bd\\u22122 and the band upper-frequency bound \\u03bd2 is much greater than the lower bound \\u03bd1. We also define a fluence ratio as\\\\begin{eqnarray}&&{\\\\eta }_{\\\\nu }({\\\\nu }_{c})=\\\\displaystyle \\\\frac{{F}_{\\\\nu ,\\\\mathrm{Band}}}{{F}_{\\\\nu ,\\\\mathrm{Radio}}}.\\\\end{eqnarray}     \\\\tag{     2     }    In this work, we consider how constraints on \\u03b7 and \\u03b7\\u03bd based on the possible detection, or nondetection, of multiwavelength FRB counterparts can test FRB models.Until 2019 December, no FRB multiwavelength counterpart has been confirmed. Most previous observational constraints on \\u03b7 are derived from searches for multiwavelength transient emissions that are close to the FRBs in both time and location (see Section 5.2 for references). It is also possible to search for multiwavelength transient events that are close to the FRBs in location only, but at any time.In this work, we explore a third method: a blind search of the whole sky for unclassified multiwavelength transient events at any time. Several surveys across the optical and high-energy bands explore the sky with subsecond time resolution. We develop and demonstrate a method to estimate \\u03b7 by combining relevant multiwavelength survey parameters with the fluence distribution of the currently observed FRB population. This method can only directly constrain \\u03b7 when the statistics of unclassified short-duration transient events are published. However, these statistics are rarely published. We therefore compare constraints derived assuming no multiwavelength FRB counterparts have been detected with predictions from FRB emission models. We find in several scenarios that existing surveys are likely/unlikely to have already detected FRB counterparts. For some surveys, we also consider the case where a fraction of their unclassified events are indeed FRB counterparts to derive upper bounds on \\u03b7.We propose our method for three reasons. First, a blind search for counterparts is meaningful because some models predict cases where the radio emission from an FRB is undetectable while the counterpart is. For example, Metzger et al. (2019) show that high-energy counterpart emission may escape a dense medium surrounding the source even when the radio emission is subject to the obscuring effects of scattering and absorption. Second, it is reasonable to make use of the statistical properties of FRBs. The estimated FRB rate above {F}_{\\\\nu ,0}\\\\sim 2\\\\,\\\\mathrm{Jy}\\\\,\\\\mathrm{ms} is {R}_{0}\\\\approx 1.7\\\\times {10}^{3}\\\\,\\\\,{\\\\mathrm{sky}}^{-1}\\\\,{\\\\mathrm{day}}^{-1} (Bhandari et al. 2018), sufficiently large to be treated as a common event for relatively large telescopes scanning across most of the sky in a blind survey (Vedantham et al. 2016). Third, we will show that our technique provides stronger constraints than previous multiwavelength observations in the current situation wherein no counterpart has been detected.We explain the method to estimate the band-to-radio energy ratio \\u03b7 in Section 2, introduce the surveys under consideration in Section 3, and show our calculations and results in Section 4. In Section 5, we compare our results with theoretical predictions made by leading FRB emission models. We also compare our results with previous observational constraints and discuss observational strategies for future blind searching. We conclude in Section 6. 2. MethodsWe adopt the broken-power-law specific-fluence cumulative distribution function (CDF) estimated using the Australian Square Kilometre Array Pathfinder (ASKAP) and Parkes FRB samples (James et al. 2019):\\\\begin{eqnarray}&&R({F}_{\\\\nu })={\\\\int }_{F}^{\\\\infty }r({F}_{\\\\nu }^{{\\\\prime} }){{dF}}_{\\\\nu }^{{\\\\prime} },\\\\end{eqnarray}     \\\\tag{     3a     }     \\\\begin{eqnarray}&&=\\\\,{R}_{0}{\\\\left(\\\\displaystyle \\\\frac{{F}_{\\\\nu }}{{F}_{\\\\nu ,0}}\\\\right)}^{{\\\\alpha }_{1}}\\\\,\\\\,\\\\,({F}_{\\\\nu ,\\\\min }\\\\lt {F}_{\\\\nu }\\\\lt {F}_{\\\\nu ,b}),\\\\end{eqnarray}     \\\\tag{     3b     }     \\\\begin{eqnarray}&&=\\\\,{R}_{b}{\\\\left(\\\\displaystyle \\\\frac{{F}_{\\\\nu }}{{F}_{\\\\nu ,b}}\\\\right)}^{{\\\\alpha }_{2}}\\\\,\\\\,\\\\,({F}_{\\\\nu }\\\\gt {F}_{\\\\nu ,b}).\\\\end{eqnarray}     \\\\tag{     3c     }    Here, R(F\\u03bd) is the FRB rate (in the usual units of sky\\u22121 day\\u22121) above a given fluence threshold F\\u03bd in the radio band, r(F\\u03bd) is the differential fluence distribution function, \\u03b11 = \\u22121.18, \\u03b12 = \\u22122.2, {F}_{\\\\nu ,\\\\min } is the (observationally unconstrained) fluence cutoff in the radio band, {F}_{\\\\nu ,0}\\\\sim 2 Jy ms is the fluence completeness threshold for the Parkes FRB searches (Keane & Petroff 2015), R0 \\u2248 1.7 \\u00d7 103 sky\\u22121 day\\u22121 is the estimated rate above {F}_{\\\\nu ,0} (Bhandari et al. 2018), {F}_{\\\\nu ,b} is the fluence break which we choose to be 15 Jy ms, and Rb \\u2248 171 sky\\u22121 day\\u22121 is the rate above Fb calculated from Equation (3(b)).We assume that in any other emission band the fluence CDF, \\\\tilde{R}, has the same functional form as R, except with a shift in abscissa (i.e., horizontally) and a renormalization:\\\\begin{eqnarray}&&\\\\tilde{R}\\\\left({F}_{\\\\nu }\\\\right)=R\\\\left(\\\\displaystyle \\\\frac{{F}_{\\\\nu }}{{\\\\eta }_{\\\\nu }}\\\\right).\\\\end{eqnarray}     \\\\tag{     4     }    We use properties of multiwavelength surveys to estimate {\\\\eta }_{\\\\nu } by calculating the degree to which the distribution needs to be shifted in its abscissa to achieve the same detection rate in two different bands.We now describe how estimates of \\u03b7 and \\u03b7\\u03bd are made. Suppose that a transient survey has a field of view (FOV) of \\u03a9 steradians, effectively lasts for n days, and has not detected any FRB counterpart. The survey operates at frequencies from \\u03bd1 to \\u03bd2, with a center frequency of \\u03bdc. Our method involves the following steps:1.  Convert the instrumental detection sensitivity threshold to an energy flux, f0.(a)  If the photon flux threshold fph is specified, we calculate f0 using the specifications of each instrument and the weighted average photon frequency \\\\langle \\\\nu \\\\rangle in this band, assuming a typical photon index of \\u22122 (i.e., a spectral index of \\u22121; see, e.g., Atwood et al. 2009)1 :\\\\begin{eqnarray}\\\\begin{array}{rcl}{f}_{0} & = & {f}_{\\\\mathrm{ph}}\\\\cdot h\\\\langle \\\\nu \\\\rangle ,\\\\\\\\ & = & {f}_{\\\\mathrm{ph}}\\\\cdot h\\\\,\\\\displaystyle \\\\frac{{\\\\displaystyle \\\\int }_{{\\\\nu }_{1}}^{{\\\\nu }_{2}}d\\\\nu \\\\,{\\\\nu }^{-2}\\\\,\\\\nu }{{\\\\displaystyle \\\\int }_{{\\\\nu }_{1}}^{{\\\\nu }_{2}}d\\\\nu \\\\,{\\\\nu }^{-2}},\\\\\\\\ & = & {f}_{\\\\mathrm{ph}}\\\\cdot h\\\\,\\\\displaystyle \\\\frac{{ln}({\\\\nu }_{2}/{\\\\nu }_{1})}{{\\\\nu }_{1}^{-1}-{\\\\nu }_{2}^{-1}}.\\\\end{array}\\\\end{eqnarray}     \\\\tag{     5     }     (b)   If we know the limiting magnitude m, \\\\begin{eqnarray}&&{f}_{0}={10}^{-0.4m}\\\\cdot {\\\\nu }_{1}\\\\cdot {f}_{\\\\nu ,{\\\\rm{m}}0}.\\\\end{eqnarray}     \\\\tag{     6     }    Here, {f}_{\\\\nu ,{\\\\rm{m}}0} is the specific energy flux of an object with zero magnitude in that band and magnitude system (Frei & Gunn 1994; Fukugita et al. 1996; Bessell et al. 1998). 2.  Scale the detection limiting energy flux f0 according to a timescale \\u0394t. Specifically, if the survey has an automatic self-trigger algorithm for burst candidates, we use the trigger timescale(s) ttrig. Otherwise, we use the nominal instrumental time resolution tres. Because the signal-to-noise ratio S/N \\u221d \\u0394t1/2, the detection flux threshold f0 \\u221d \\u0394t\\u22121/2. (Note that if the burst duration tburst < \\u0394t, the corresponding intrinsic burst flux needs to be higher than f0. Otherwise, they are the same.)3.  Compute the fluence thresholds of the burst in the band of interest.(a)  If tburst < \\u0394t, the band-integrated burst fluence limit is {F}_{0,\\\\mathrm{Band}}={f}_{0}\\\\cdot {\\\\rm{\\\\Delta }}t.(b)  Otherwise, \\u0394t is too short for the burst. One should either choose a different timescale or bin-adjacent time samples. The specific-fluence threshold is {F}_{\\\\nu ,0,\\\\mathrm{Band}}\\\\approx {F}_{0,\\\\mathrm{Band}}/{\\\\nu }_{1}. In addition, we require that the number of photons received within the timescale (\\u0394t) by the telescope's effective collecting area (A) is at least one. When this is not satisfied, we replace the photon flux threshold fph (step 1) with 1\\\\,\\\\mathrm{photon}\\\\,{\\\\rm{\\\\Delta }}{t}^{-1}\\\\,{A}^{-1} and repeat the previous steps.4.  Calculate the event-rate upper bound in this survey if no candidate was detected:\\\\begin{eqnarray}&&R({F}_{\\\\nu ,0,\\\\mathrm{Band}})\\\\leqslant \\\\displaystyle \\\\frac{3}{n}\\\\displaystyle \\\\frac{4\\\\pi }{{\\\\rm{\\\\Omega }}}\\\\,{\\\\mathrm{sky}}^{-1}\\\\,{\\\\mathrm{day}}^{-1}.\\\\end{eqnarray}     \\\\tag{     7     }    A nondetection means a Poisson single-sided upper limit of 3 at the 95% confidence level (Gehrels 1986). Alternatively, if there were x candidate events in this survey, the event rate would be\\\\begin{eqnarray}&&R=\\\\displaystyle \\\\frac{x}{n}\\\\displaystyle \\\\frac{4\\\\pi }{{\\\\rm{\\\\Omega }}}\\\\,{\\\\mathrm{sky}}^{-1}\\\\,{\\\\mathrm{day}}^{-1}.\\\\end{eqnarray}     \\\\tag{     8     }     5.  Solve for the radio-band fluence threshold {F}_{\\\\nu ,0,\\\\mathrm{Radio}} that would have produced the same rate R using Equation (3).6.  Find the fluence ratios:\\\\begin{eqnarray}&&{\\\\eta }_{\\\\nu }({\\\\nu }_{c})\\\\leqslant {F}_{\\\\nu ,0,\\\\mathrm{Band}}/{F}_{\\\\nu ,0,\\\\mathrm{Radio}}\\\\end{eqnarray}     \\\\tag{     9     }    and\\\\begin{eqnarray}&&\\\\eta ({\\\\nu }_{c})\\\\leqslant {F}_{0,\\\\mathrm{Band}}/{F}_{0,\\\\mathrm{Radio}}\\\\approx \\\\displaystyle \\\\frac{{F}_{0,\\\\mathrm{Band}}/{\\\\nu }_{1,\\\\mathrm{Band}}}{{F}_{0,\\\\mathrm{Radio}}/{\\\\nu }_{1,\\\\mathrm{Radio}}}.\\\\end{eqnarray}     \\\\tag{     10     }    Here, {F}_{\\\\nu ,0,\\\\mathrm{Band}} and {F}_{\\\\nu ,0,\\\\mathrm{Radio}} have been found in steps 3 and 5, respectively.  3. Existing SurveysWe demonstrate the application of the methods outlined above using existing high-time-resolution transient surveys from the NIR band up to the TeV band. Following model predictions (see Section 5), we assume that FRB counterparts are fast transient events shorter than about a few minutes. In this work, we only focus on surveys with short cadences (\\u22722 minutes), large FOVs, and relatively high sensitivities.Table 1 lists the survey instruments considered in this work. The survey durations are counted until 2019 October 1. We assume full-time operation since the launch date for space missions and a typical average observation time of 8 hr per day since the operation date for ground-based instruments. We adopt the detection threshold used by each instrument, although some of them correspond to different statistical S/Ns, as each survey could have different false-positive rates. We list the threshold corresponding to the given timescale, unless specified otherwise. We increase the detection threshold of MAGIC and Fermi/LAT (at the lower timescale) to 2.4 \\u00d7 10\\u221211 and 7\\\\times {10}^{-8}\\\\,\\\\mathrm{photon}\\\\,{\\\\mathrm{cm}}^{-2}\\\\,{{\\\\rm{s}}}^{-1}, respectively, to satisfy the requirement that at least one photon is received by the corresponding telescopes within the timescales (step 3).Table 1.

The Burst And Transient Source Experiment (BATSE) on the Compton Gamma Ray Observatory (CGRO) was in operation from 2000 April to 2009 June. The threshold was for a 1 s burst.  gBarthelmy et al. (2005). The BAT monitor archive begins on 2005 February 12. The threshold is for a \\u223c1 s peak.  hMatsuoka et al. (2009). MAXI was launched on 2009 July 16. The threshold corresponds to one International Space Station orbit, in which an object stays in the FOV for at least 45 s. For the timescales, we ignore those with \\u22651 scan as they are too long for a millisecond-scale transient.  iPrusti et al.

All of the high-energy surveys selected in this work have been designed to be sensitive to GRB-like transient events (\\u223c0.1 to \\u223c100 s). Each survey has its own transient-candidate self-trigger algorithm that runs on board commensally with observations using a range of trial trigger timescales. In addition, it is also possible to manually search the survey data afterwards for candidate events using different algorithms and timescales. For Fermi/LAT, we adopt the timescales optimized for FRB-counterpart searching (Cunningham et al. 2019), as the onboard trigger only responds to very bright bursts due to the high cosmic-ray rate.2  For the other high-energy surveys, we list the trial timescales used by the corresponding self-trigger algorithms. In the optical band, we use the nominal time resolutions for all instruments. 4. ResultsWe estimate \\u03b7 for each survey/instrument (Table 1) following the steps introduced in Section 2. Table 2 and Figure 1 summarize the results. In Section 4.1, we make the assumption that no counterpart has been detected to demonstrate the power of our technique. In Section 4.2, we investigate the implications of assuming that counterparts exist among the unclassified transient events in some surveys.Zoom In     Zoom Out     Reset image size      Figure 1.

Download table as:              ASCIITypeset image4.1. Band-to-radio Fluence Ratios Assuming NondetectionsIn Table 2, we list 95% confidence upper limits on the rate of FRB counterparts and on \\u03b7 for each survey. We use a reference frequency of {\\\\nu }_{1,\\\\mathrm{Radio}}=1.182\\\\,\\\\mathrm{GHz} (the lower limit of the Parkes radio band) to convert the specific fluence into the band-integrated radio fluence (in step 6). We assume that the counterpart duration tburst is shorter than the timescale \\u0394t for all instruments (in step 3 above) and discuss the alternative case in Section 5. For surveys with multiple timescales, we scale the flux and fluence following steps (2) and (3) using the shortest and longest timescales. We list the corresponding results in two rows in Table 2 and plot both ratios in Figure 1(a).Our results are robust within an order of magnitude to a selection of variations in the fluence distribution model in Equation (3) (Macquart & Ekers 2018). We vary the broken-power-law indices \\u03b11 and \\u03b12 by \\u00b10.7 and find that the results change by 46% (\\u03b11 = \\u22120.48), 86% (\\u03b11 = \\u22121.88), 92% (\\u03b12 = \\u22121.5), and 270% (\\u03b12 = \\u22122.9), respectively. We also use a single-power-law fluence distribution model with an index of \\u22121.5 and find that the results change by less than 88%. However, our results are sensitive to the choice of the photon index in the \\u03b3-ray band. In step 1, we assume a Crab-like photon index of 2 to calculate the energy flux limit from the photon flux limit for MAGIC, Fermi/LAT, and GBM. We vary the photon index to \\u22122.5 and \\u22121.5 and find that the resulting fluence ratios decrease/increase by 70% and one order-of-magnitude, respectively. There is little theoretical guidance on what range of photon indices is reasonable for FRB counterparts, but the example of GRBs suggests that photon indices >\\u22122 are expected below peak energies (in \\u03bdF\\u03bd spectra) of typically 100 keV\\u20131 MeV, and photon indices <\\u22122 are expected above the peak energies (Preece et al. 1998).4.2. What if FRB Counterparts Have Been Detected?No compelling candidate FRB counterpart at any wavelength had been reported until the end of 2019. However, we cannot exclude the possibility that some unclassified short transient events found in existing surveys could be associated with FRBs. It is beyond the scope of this paper to estimate what fraction of them might be FRB counterparts, but we will investigate the results assuming the extreme case where all of them are FRB counterparts. We show the results in Table 2 (within parentheses) and Figure 1(b) (dashed lines).In the Fermi/GBM trigger catalog3  to the end of 2019, there were 7045 triggered events, and 370 of them were marked as \\\"uncertain classification.\\\" We discuss two limiting cases for these unclassified short transient events. First, if none of them were FRB counterparts, the results would be the same as those of Section 4.1. Second, if all of them were FRB counterparts, we estimate \\u03b7 using the method in Section 2. Using the shortest trigger timescale as an example, steps 1 to 3 remain the same, so the Fermi/GBM fluence limit is still 1.02 \\u00d7 1018 Jy ms Hz. In step 4, the rate is now estimated to be R=\\\\tfrac{370}{4132\\\\,\\\\mathrm{days}}\\\\tfrac{4\\\\pi \\\\,{\\\\mathrm{sky}}^{-1}}{8}=0.14\\\\,{\\\\mathrm{day}}^{-1}\\\\,{\\\\mathrm{sky}}^{-1}, \\u223c100 times larger than the upper limit assuming nondetection. In the radio band, the fluence threshold that would have produced the new detection rate is 380 Jy ms, or 4.49 \\u00d7 1011 Jy ms Hz. Hence, \\\\eta =\\\\tfrac{1.02\\\\times {10}^{18}}{4.49\\\\times {10}^{11}}\\\\approx 2.27\\\\times {10}^{6}, \\u223c10 times higher than our result in Section 4.1.In the MAXI trigger catalog4  between 2011 April 18 and 2020 January 28, 168 events were classified as \\\"either GRB or unknown X-ray transient.\\\" If all of them were FRB counterparts, the rate would be R=\\\\tfrac{168}{3207\\\\,\\\\mathrm{days}}\\\\tfrac{4\\\\pi \\\\,{\\\\mathrm{sky}}^{-1}}{0.0731}=9.00\\\\,{\\\\mathrm{day}}^{-1}\\\\,{\\\\mathrm{sky}}^{-1}. The radio fluence that could have produced the same rate would be 6.76 \\u00d7 1010 Jy ms Hz, and the fluence ratio would be \\\\eta =\\\\tfrac{4.70\\\\times {10}^{17}}{6.76\\\\times {10}^{10}}\\\\approx 6.95\\\\times {10}^{6}, \\u223c7 times higher than our previous result.In the optical band, we only use the most constraining result (from Gaia) in the following comparison with model predictions and previous observations. No unclassified fast Gaia transient has been reported,5  and so we tentatively maintain the nondetection assumption for Gaia in our results. This may change as more Gaia data are searched for unclassified fast transients. 5. DiscussionWe have developed and demonstrated a technique to estimate the ratios between FRB energy output in the radio band and in various bands from the near-IR to \\u03b3-rays. Preliminary results based on published surveys for fast transients (Table 1) are presented in Table 2 and Figure 1 in two extreme cases: assuming either that no FRB counterpart has been detected or assuming that all unclassified fast transients are FRB counterparts. Our method uses the statistical properties of the observed FRB population, while most of the previous observational estimations are based on multiwavelength observations at the locations of individual FRB events. In this section, we will compare our results with theoretical predictions and previous observations, and briefly discuss possible future FRB-counterpart search strategies.5.1. Comparison to Theoretical PredictionsThe two leading FRB emission mechanisms are the synchrotron maser and coherent curvature radiation. We first compare our high-energy results with predictions from these two types of models, as well as a class of models generally involving contemporaneous high-energy flares, and the cosmic comb model. We then compare our optical results with model predictions made under five scenarios. Finally, we conclude by calculating the model-predicted counterpart detection rate for some of the existing surveys (Table 3). This section is partly intended as a pedagogical resource for future studies of FRB multiwavelength counterparts.Table 3.

Download table as:              ASCIITypeset image5.1.1. Metzger et al. (2019) ModelSynchrotron masers have been widely discussed as an astrophysical coherent emission process (e.g., Hoshino & Arons 1991; Long & Pe'er 2018), and one common variation is coherent emission from synchrotron masers produced by ultrarelativistic shock in magnetized plasmas (e.g., Langdon et al. 1988; Lyubarsky 2014; Beloborodov 2017, 2019; Margalit et al. 2020; Metzger et al. 2019). Metzger et al. (2019) describe a model using particle-in-cell (PIC) simulation results for maser emission and the dynamics of self-similar shock deceleration. Magnetar flares eject supersonic ultrarelativistic ion\\u2013electron shells into the surrounding magnetized transrelativistic ion\\u2013electron plasma released by previous flares. The forward shock creates a population inversion and enables the synchrotron-maser process, which results in a narrowly peaked coherent radio emission putatively responsible for FRBs. The same forward shock, however, primarily dissipates energy through a synchrotron \\\"afterglow\\\" that will result in observable high-energy counterparts. The model predicts that the observed counterpart luminosity is {L}_{\\\\gamma }\\\\sim {10}^{45}\\u2013{10}^{46}\\\\,\\\\,\\\\mathrm{erg}\\\\,{{\\\\rm{s}}}^{-1}, with a duration of \\u223c0.1\\u201310 ms in the MeV\\u2013GeV band, and {L}_{{\\\\rm{X}}}\\\\sim {10}^{42}\\\\mbox{--}{10}^{53}\\\\,\\\\,\\\\mathrm{erg}\\\\,{{\\\\rm{s}}}^{-1}, with a duration of \\u223c0.1\\u20131 s in the keV band. A weak optical counterpart is possible if the upstream plasma were composed of electrons and positrons rather than electrons and ions; we do not consider any resulting quantitative predictions here. We convert the above predictions to fluence ratios \\u03b7, which can be directly compared with our results. Assuming a typical FRB of duration 1 ms initiated by a flare of energy \\u223c1044 erg, the results of Metzger et al. (2019) imply ratios of 6 \\u00d7 104, 105, 105, and 2 \\u00d7 104  for a counterpart whose band starts from 100 MeV, 1 MeV, 10 keV, and 1 keV, respectively (hollow magenta circles in Figure 1).5.1.2. Beloborodov (2019) ModelMeanwhile, Beloborodov (2019) proposes that the synchrotron maser is formed instead when the magnetar giant flares launch ultrarelativistic blast waves ({\\\\rm{\\\\Gamma }}\\\\gtrsim {10}^{3}) into the relativistic (\\u0393 \\u223c 102), persistent magnetar wind outflow, which consists of e\\u00b1. A bright optical counterpart occurs only when the blast wave strikes a hot wind bubble in the slow ion tail of a previous flare. The optical flash is estimated to have a duration of \\u223c1 s and an energy upper limit of \\u223c1044 erg. The optical-to-radio fluence ratio would be \\u03b7 \\u2272 105 using the average FRB 121102 burst energy of 1039 erg (Law et al. 2017) and \\u03b7 \\u223c 103 using the FRB energy corresponding to the strongest explosion, which produces the brightest optical flash in their model. The former is shown in Figure 1 to compare with our results, as our technique utilizes the statistical features of the entire FRB population. The latter prediction could be comparable to results of simultaneous multiwavelength observations of individual events. Note that in this model many FRBs do not have optical counterparts, as only strong magnetar flares may have significant ion tails.5.1.3. Soft Gamma-Ray Repeater Giant Flares as FRB CounterpartsMore generally, in many FRB models, the emission processes are initiated by soft gamma-ray repeater (SGR) giant flares. The energy released by giant flares is typically specified in the \\u03b3-ray band, where the Fermi/GBM survey suggests constraints ranging between \\u03b7 \\u2272 105 (0.1 s counterparts, assuming no extant detections) and \\u03b7 \\u223c 107 (100 s counterparts, assuming all unclassified events are giant flares). These constraints can be used to test the hypothesis that each giant flare corresponds to an FRB.Following Ofek (2007), the rate of giant flares in the Milky Way, which hosts four SGRs, is \\u22720.002 yr\\u22121 for energies ESGR > 4 \\u00d7 1046 erg (this rate is based on an analysis of extragalactic giant-flare candidates) and \\u223c0.1 yr\\u22121 for energies ESGR > 2 \\u00d7 1044 erg (Poisson errors ignored; this rate is derived from the Milky Way alone). Ofek (2007) derives the number of SGRs in a given galaxy by comparing its core-collapse supernova rate with that of the Milky Way, which is justified given the short lifetimes (O(kyr)) of active SGRs. As the overall star formation rate is a reasonable proxy for the core-collapse supernova rate (Madau & Dickinson 2014), we can derive the (local) volumetric rate of giant flares by scaling the Milky Way rate by the ratio of the local star formation rate density (0.015 M\\u2299 yr\\u22121 Mpc\\u22123; Madau & Dickinson 2014) and the Milky Way star formation rate (1.9 M\\u2299 yr\\u22121; Chomiuk & Povich 2011). For ESGR > 4 \\u00d7 1046 erg and ESGR > 2 \\u00d7 1044 erg, the volumetric giant-flare rates are \\u22722 \\u00d7 104 Gpc\\u22123 yr\\u22121 and \\u223c8 \\u00d7 105 Gpc\\u22123 yr\\u22121 respectively. If each giant flare produces an FRB, these volumetric rates correspond to estimates of the FRB volumetric rates for radio-band energy releases EFRB = ESGR/\\u03b7 (e.g., {E}_{\\\\mathrm{FRB}}=4\\\\times {10}^{39}\\\\,\\\\mathrm{erg} and {E}_{\\\\mathrm{FRB}}=2\\\\times {10}^{37}\\\\,\\\\mathrm{erg}, respectively, for \\u03b7 = 107). The volumetric rate of FRBs in the local universe inferred from the Canadian Hydrogen Intensity Mapping Experiment (CHIME) is \\u223c105 Gpc\\u22123 yr\\u22121 (Ravi 2019), approximately above an energy threshold of 2 \\u00d7 1037 erg s\\u22121.6  Thus, contrary to previous studies (Kulkarni et al. 2014; Ravi 2019), the giant-flare rate may in fact be too high to explain the FRB rate. This result would be strengthened if the value of \\u03b7 is substantially lower than the conservative upper bound of 107 derived herein. We note, however, that all rate estimates above are subject to severe Poisson errors and that this analysis will require significant refinement before firm conclusions can be drawn.A similar analysis can be applied to any multiwavelength event that triggers an FRB. This is of particular relevance to the \\\"cosmic comb\\\" model, where a regular pulsar magnetosphere is \\\"combed\\\" by a nearby strong plasma stream with a ram pressure higher than the magnetic pressure in the magnetosphere. The stream triggers magnetic reconnection that accelerates particles within the magnetosphere, producing coherent emission through the curvature-radiation or cyclotron instability mechanisms. On the one hand, when the plasma stream comes from nearby energetic events, such as active galactic nucleus flares, those events should be detected as FRB counterparts. On the other hand, when the stream comes from closer but less-luminous events, such as stellar flares from a companion star, no detectable counterpart would occur.5.1.4. Curvature RadiationAnother commonly discussed coherent emission process is curvature radiation (e.g., Kumar et al. 2017; Lu & Kumar 2018). For example, Lu & Kumar (2018) propose a model where counterstreaming e\\u00b1 plasma inside the twisted magnetosphere of a magnetar rapidly clumps due to the two-stream instability. When magnetic reconnection occurs near the magnetar surface, these clumps are accelerated along magnetic field lines and radiate coherently. The model predicts fluence ratios of \\u03b7 \\u223c 1 in all bands, so there would be no detectable FRB counterpart.5.1.5. Fast Optical Bursts Associated with FRBsWe compare our most constraining result from Gaia (\\u03b7 \\u2272 103, assuming nondetection and using the Gaia time resolution of 4.5 s) with predictions made by Yang et al. (2019). These authors investigate the detectability of \\\"fast optical bursts\\\" (FOBs) associated with FRBs in two broad cases and five specific scenarios. We convert them to the constraints on the optical-to-radio fluence ratios assuming an FRB of 1 ms duration (hollow magenta triangles in Figure 1).Case 1: FOB formed by inverse-Compton scattering between the FRB photons and ambient electrons.a.  FOB and FRB both formed in the pulsar magnetosphere (10\\u22127 \\u2272 \\u03b7 \\u2272 104, tFOB \\u223c 1 ms).b.  FOB formed in a surrounding nebula and FRB near the neutron star (\\u03b7 \\u2272 108, tFOB \\u223c a few \\u00d7 10 s).c.  FRB formed by synchrotron-maser mechanism and FOB formed by inverse-Compton scattering between the maser electrons and the FRB photons (\\u03b7 \\u2272 0.38, tFOB \\u223c 1 ms). Case 2: FOB and FRB formed by the same emission mechanism.a.  Curvature radiation by particle bunches (\\u03b7 \\u2272 3.8 \\u00d7 10\\u22125, {t}_{\\\\mathrm{FOB}}\\\\sim 1 ms).b.  Synchrotron maser (\\u03b7 \\u2272 3.8 \\u00d7 10\\u22124, {t}_{\\\\mathrm{FOB}}\\\\sim 1 ms).  We omit case 1(c) and case 2 from Figure 1 as they are too low to compare with any existing optical telescope. Compared with our Gaia result, the upper limits predicted by cases 1(a) and 1(b) are greater by \\u223c1 and 5 orders of magnitude, while predictions of the other three scenarios are lower by \\u223c4, 8, and 7 orders of magnitude, respectively. Hence, a detection of FRB counterparts by Gaia (or indeed any other optical telescope) would rule out case 1(c) and case 2, and it might be able to rule out case 1(a) if the observed fluence ratio lies between \\u223c104 and 108.5.1.6. How Many Multiwavelength FRB Counterparts Should Blind Surveys Detect?Finally, we estimate the counterpart detection rate from each model (Table 3) by combining the model-predicted \\u03b7 with the observed FRB fluence distribution. For example, the theoretical counterpart duration at 1 MeV (2.4 \\u00d7 1020 Hz) from the Metzger et al. (2019) model is \\u223c50 ms. The shortest trigger timescales of Fermi/GBM and CGRO/BATSE above 50 ms are both 64 ms. At this timescale, the band-integrated fluence threshold is {F}_{0,\\\\mathrm{GBM}}\\\\,=2\\\\times {10}^{18} Jy ms Hz (7.6 \\u00d7 1017 for BATSE) and {F}_{\\\\nu ,0,\\\\mathrm{GBM}}\\\\,\\\\approx \\\\tfrac{2\\\\times {10}^{18}\\\\,\\\\mathrm{Jy}\\\\,\\\\mathrm{ms}\\\\,\\\\mathrm{Hz}}{2.4\\\\times {10}^{20}\\\\,\\\\mathrm{Hz}}\\\\approx 8.4\\\\times {10}^{-3} Jy ms (3.1 \\u00d7 10\\u22123 for BATSE). The model predicts that \\u03b7\\u03bd \\u2248 4.1 \\u00d7 10\\u22127 at \\u03bd1 = 1  MeV, so the expected counterpart rate above F\\u03bd,0, GBM in the GBM band would be \\\\tilde{R}({F}_{\\\\nu })=R(\\\\tfrac{{F}_{\\\\nu ,0,\\\\mathrm{GBM}}}{{\\\\eta }_{\\\\nu }}) = R(2.1\\\\times {10}^{4}\\\\,\\\\mathrm{Jy}\\\\,\\\\mathrm{ms})\\\\approx 2.13\\\\,\\\\times {10}^{-5}\\\\,{\\\\mathrm{sky}}^{-1}\\\\,{\\\\mathrm{day}}^{-1} (Equations (7) and 3(c); 1.9 \\u00d7 10\\u22124 for BATSE). On average, Fermi/GBM is expected to detect one such event every \\\\langle n\\\\rangle \\\\approx {(2.13\\\\times {10}^{-5})}^{-1}(\\\\tfrac{4\\\\pi }{8\\\\,\\\\mathrm{sr}})\\\\approx 7.36\\\\,\\\\times \\\\,{10}^{4} days (5.3 \\u00d7 103 for BATSE). By comparing \\\\langle n\\\\rangle with the relevant survey durations n (the last two columns in Table 3), it is unlikely that Fermi/LAT, GBM, or BATSE have already detected any counterparts events or will detect one in the near future, according to the prediction of Metzger et al. (2019).As another example, we interpolate the Metzger et al. (2019) predictions to 100 keV and conservatively assume a 1 s duration counterpart in the Swift/BAT band (and the CGRO/BATSE band) with \\u03b7\\u03bd \\u2248 4.1 \\u00d7 10\\u22126. At this timescale, {F}_{\\\\nu ,0,\\\\mathrm{BAT}}\\\\approx 4.18\\\\times {10}^{-2}\\\\,\\\\,\\\\mathrm{Jy}\\\\,\\\\mathrm{ms}, and the expected counterpart rate in that band would be R(\\\\tfrac{4.18\\\\times {10}^{-2}\\\\,\\\\mathrm{Jy}\\\\,\\\\mathrm{ms}}{4.1\\\\times {10}^{-6}})=R({10}^{4}\\\\,\\\\mathrm{Jy}\\\\,\\\\mathrm{ms})\\\\,\\\\approx {10}^{-4}\\\\,{\\\\mathrm{sky}}^{-1}\\\\,{\\\\mathrm{day}}^{-1} and \\\\langle n\\\\rangle \\\\approx 8.95\\\\times {10}^{4} days. Swift/BAT is not expected to have detected any FRB counterpart based on this model, unless the counterpart duration at 100 keV is significantly shorter (\\u227264 ms).We cannot comment on the predictions from Beloborodov (2017) and Yang et al. (2019), as their models only indicate the lower limits to \\\\langle n\\\\rangle.5.1.7. Caveat EmptorCaution should be taken in the comparisons described above. First, our technique relies on a homogeneous FRB population distribution, and the synchrotron-maser and curvature-radiation models may not be able thus far to explain nonrepeating FRBs. Although it has been argued that all FRB sources repeat in their lifetimes (Ravi 2019), some sources are clearly more active than others, and it is not yet clear whether or not they belong to the same population groups. Second, the high-energy counterpart could be either the giant flare that initiates the FRB emission processes or the afterglow, or both, but their contributions are observationally indistinguishable. Third, it might be difficult to distinguish intrinsic emissions from propagation effects, because any dense intervening medium has different attenuation effects on different wavelengths. For example, in the model of Metzger et al. (2019), it is unclear whether the keV photons would escape from supernova ejecta shells surrounding the proposed magnetars or get absorbed by the neutral gas on the FRB timescale (Margalit et al. 2018). This ambiguity makes it difficult to constrain the model based on the nondetection of X-ray counterparts. Fourth, in this work, we only focus on surveys with cadences less than 2 minutes, but longer-duration counterparts may also be possible (e.g., Petroff et al. 2015). In this case, sensitive surveys on these longer timescales should also be considered.A further issue is that the brightest FRB sources may in fact be missed by some of the multiwavelength surveys because of the sparsity of these FRBs on the sky. Consider the possibility that the nearest FRB sources are the brightest (Shannon et al. 2018). The nearest sources might be missed by surveys using telescopes with small FOVs that are restricted to certain portions of the sky. Our technique assumes that FRBs are uniformly distributed over the sky region scanned by a survey, which is likely true for distant FRBs but may not be true for nearby FRBs or those near the Galactic plane. Although over time the anisotropic distribution would be averaged out by successive surveys, this issue may result in erroneously low estimates of \\u03b7. However, this effect is mitigated by our incorporation of a Poisson error in Step 4 in Section 2, in the case of multiwavelength nondetections. It is also not a major issue for our analysis of the surveys with cataloged unidentified detections (Fermi/GBM, MAXI), because they cover the full sky besides the Galactic plane.5.2. Comparison to Other ObservationsAs is evident from Figure 1, our technique generally provides stronger constraints on \\u03b7 than previous observations. We consider a selection of previous observational results in turn.Some high-energy transient surveys have been blindly searched for FRB-counterpart candidates without using knowledge of individual FRB events. Yamasaki et al. (2016) (O4 in Figure 1) performed a blind search for \\u03b3-ray flashes (duration 1\\u201310 ms) using the 7 yr Fermi/LAT data. No event is found after removing flashes associated with known steady \\u03b3-ray sources and false events produced by the diffuse background. They found a \\u03b3-ray to radio fluence ratio of \\u03b7 \\u2272 (4.2 \\u223c 12) \\u00d7 107 by modeling FRBs as standard candles with a power-law \\u03b3-ray spectrum and estimating the comoving FRB rate density using the nine FRBs detected by then. In comparison, our technique adopts a model-independent FRB population distribution based on a directly measurable quantity (fluence) and a significantly larger sample (\\u223c50). Using our technique, we find \\u03b7 \\u2272 1.7 \\u00d7 106 (100 ms) based on the nondetection in the 7 yr of Fermi/LAT data.In the optical band, we estimate \\u03b7 from a few survey sub-data sets that have been blindly searched for fast transients. Wevers et al. (2018; O8 in Figure 1) developed a method to blindly search the Gaia Photometric Science Alerts database for fast transients between tens of seconds to hours. They demonstrated the method on a trial data set that spans \\u223c23.5 deg2 of sky and repeatedly scanned 40\\u201350 times. Four events produced by stellar flares are found but no unclassified event is detected. The nondetection implies a optical-to-radio-band fluence ratio of \\u03b7 \\u2272 4 \\u00d7 104 using our technique. In addition, Andreoni et al. (2020; O9 in Figure 1) specifically searched for extragalactic fast optical transients with durations down to 70 s using the Dark Energy Camera as part of the Deeper Wider Faster program. The g-band limiting magnitude of one single exposure (20 s) is \\u223c23 mag (AB), the FOV is 2.52 deg2, and the total observation time of their data set is 25.76 hr. Four events with uncertain classifications are detected, but no \\u03b3-ray signal or FRB is found within \\u00b11 day near these transients. Using our technique, the optical-to-radio-band fluence ratio is \\u03b7 \\u2272 6 \\u00d7 104. Finally, Richmond et al. (2020; O10 in Figure 1) find no transients with durations from 1.5 s to 11.5 s using the Tomo-e Gozen wide-field CMOS mosaic camera data (limiting magnitude V = 15.6) with a control time of 177,502 {\\\\deg }^{2}\\\\,{\\\\rm{s}}. The nondetection implies that \\u03b7 \\u2272 106 using our technique.Most previous constraints on \\u03b7 are based on counterpart searches in the sky region of individual FRB events, either contemporaneous or not. We summarize them below and show some of the stronger constraints in Figure 1.A one-second-long X-ray counterpart was detected during the recent FRB event ST 200428A from the Galactic magnetar SGR 1935+2154 (Bochenek et al. 2020; The CHIME/FRB Collaboration et al. 2020). Based on the X-ray observations of Ridnaia et al. (2020), Bochenek et al. (2020) estimated that the band-integrated fluence ratio {F}_{X}/{F}_{\\\\mathrm{radio}}\\\\sim 3\\\\times {10}^{4} (red star in Figure 1), about one order-of-magnitude lower than our result based on the nondetection in the blind search of Swift/BAT for a one-second-long burst in a similar energy band.MAGIC Collaboration et al. (2018; O6 in Figure 1) conducted simultaneous observations of the repeating FRB 121102 using the Arecibo telescope and MAGIC (100 GeV\\u201350 TeV and the optical band). Five FRBs were detected during this time (mean fluence \\u223c2 Jy ms), but no simultaneous or persistent counterparts were found by MAGIC. This implies that {F}_{\\\\gt 100\\\\mathrm{GeV}}/{F}_{\\\\mathrm{Arecibo}}\\\\lesssim 2\\\\times {10}^{7} for a 10 ms counterpart and {F}_{\\\\mathrm{optical}}/{F}_{\\\\mathrm{Arecibo}}\\\\lesssim 4\\\\times {10}^{3} for a 1 ms counterpart.Casentini et al. (2020; O5 in Figure 1) searched the AGILE archival data for MeV\\u2013GeV counterparts of two repeating FRB sources. They find no prompt emission and estimate a band-integrated fluence ratio of {F}_{\\\\mathrm{MeV}}/{F}_{\\\\mathrm{Radio}}\\\\lesssim {10}^{8}, assuming millisecond-scale emissions in the MeV band.Cunningham et al. (2019) found no prompt high-energy counterparts with durations between 0.1 and 100 s for a sample of 23 FRBs in the Fermi/GBM, Fermi/LAT, and Swift data. They estimate the fluence ratio to be \\\\eta \\\\lesssim {10}^{7\\\\mbox{--}12} for the timescale of 0.1 s (and \\u03b7 \\u2272 108\\u201313 for 100 s).Anumarlapudi et al. (2020; O3 in Figure 1) find no prompt X-ray counterparts for a sample of 42 FRBs in the AstroSat/CZTI data (20\\u2013200 keV) and estimate the fluence ratio to be {F}_{{\\\\rm{X}}}/{F}_{\\\\mathrm{Radio}}\\\\lesssim {10}^{8-10}.Scholz et al. (2017; O1 and O2 in Figure 1) present simultaneous observations of the repeating FRB 121102 using the XMM-Newton, Chandra, and Fermi/GBM telescopes along with several radio telescopes. They found 12 radio bursts and no contemporaneous counterpart emission. They estimate that \\u03b7 \\u2272 4 \\u00d7 108 in the Fermi/GBM band and \\u03b7 \\u2272 3 \\u00d7 106 in the X-ray band (0.5\\u201310 keV) assuming bursts of <700 ms. In addition, they find no X-ray counterparts in the sky region at any time during these observations. Using the fluence distribution of radio bursts from FRB 121102, they estimate that \\u03b7 \\u2272 5 \\u00d7 107 in the XMM-Newton band (0.1\\u201315 keV) and \\u03b7 \\u2272 108 in the Chandra band (0.5\\u20137 keV), assuming 5 ms X-ray bursts.Hardy et al. (2017; O7 in Figure 1) conducted simultaneous observations of FRB 121102 using the high-speed optical camera ULTRASPEC on the Thai National Telescope and the Effelsberg radio telescope. They detected 13 radio events and no prompt optical counterparts. They compared the median radio fluence of those bursts with the optical detection limit and find {F}_{\\\\nu ,767\\\\mathrm{nm}}/{F}_{\\\\nu ,1.4\\\\mathrm{GHz}}\\\\lesssim 0.077, corresponding to a band-integrated fluence ratio of \\u03b7 \\u2272 2 \\u00d7 104.Finally, in a class of FRB models, the emission processes are initiated by SGR giant flares. Tendulkar et al. (2016) estimate that {F}_{\\\\nu ,1.4\\\\mathrm{GHz}}/{F}_{\\\\gamma }\\\\lesssim {10}^{7}\\\\,\\\\mathrm{Jy}\\\\,\\\\mathrm{ms}\\\\,{\\\\mathrm{erg}}^{-1}\\\\,{\\\\mathrm{cm}}^{2} for a 10 ms radio fluence based on the radio nondetection of a \\u03b3-ray giant flare from the magnetar SGR 1806\\u201320. Their results imply \\\\eta ={F}_{\\\\gamma }/{F}_{\\\\mathrm{radio}}\\\\gtrsim {10}^{10}, which is inconsistent with our \\u03b3-ray upper limits and thus in tension with the idea that SGR flares generally produce FRBs. This outcome is consistent with the discussion in Section 5.1.3.5.3. Future Searching StrategiesIn the absence of FRB-counterpart detections, \\u03b7 can be constrained from either simultaneous multiwavelength and radio searches or blind searches combined with the FRB population (considered in this paper). The observational strategies are slightly different in these two cases, given the nature of the FRB fluence distribution.First, we emphasize that simultaneous radio and multiwavelength searches are only worthwhile if they probe to lower values of \\u03b7 than existing blind multiwavelength searches. In a simultaneous counterpart search with a nondetection, the upper limit to \\\\eta \\\\propto {f}_{0}\\\\cdot {\\\\rm{\\\\Delta }}t. Here, \\u0394t is the timescale and f0 is the corresponding detection flux threshold. The FOV (\\u03a9) makes no difference. The total observation duration (L) is also irrelevant, until the next FRB occurs.In contrast, in a blind search where no counterpart is found, the upper limit on \\u03b7 also depends on L and \\u03a9. The counterpart rate upper bound R \\u221d L\\u22121 \\u00b7 \\u03a9\\u22121 (step 4 in Section 2). Using the broken-power-law fluence distribution, the radio fluence threshold that would have produced the same rate R is {F}_{\\\\nu ,0,\\\\mathrm{Radio}}\\\\propto {R}^{1/\\\\alpha }\\\\propto {L}^{-1/\\\\alpha }\\\\cdot {{\\\\rm{\\\\Omega }}}^{-1/\\\\alpha }. Meanwhile, the fluence threshold in the band of the counterpart is {F}_{\\\\nu ,0,\\\\mathrm{Band}}\\\\propto {f}_{0}\\\\cdot {\\\\rm{\\\\Delta }}t. Therefore,\\\\begin{eqnarray}\\\\begin{array}{rcl}\\\\eta & \\\\propto & {f}_{0}\\\\cdot {\\\\rm{\\\\Delta }}t\\\\cdot {{\\\\rm{\\\\Omega }}}^{1/\\\\alpha }\\\\cdot {L}^{1/\\\\alpha },\\\\\\\\ & \\\\propto & {10}^{-0.4{\\\\rm{m}}}\\\\cdot {\\\\rm{\\\\Delta }}t\\\\cdot {{\\\\rm{\\\\Omega }}}^{1/\\\\alpha }\\\\cdot {L}^{1/\\\\alpha }.\\\\end{array}\\\\end{eqnarray}     \\\\tag{     11     }    Here, m is the absolute magnitude and \\u03b1 is the power-law index of the fluence distribution (Equation (3)). Assuming nondetection or a low counterpart detection rate, the power-law index of the ASKAP FRB sample (\\u03b12 = \\u22122.2) is more relevant than that of Parkes (\\u03b11 = \\u22121.18), because the former describes events with rate below {R}_{b}\\\\approx 170\\\\,{\\\\mathrm{sky}}^{-1}\\\\,{\\\\mathrm{day}}^{-1} (Equation 3(c)) and the latter describes more common events (Equation 3(b)). Using \\u03b12, \\\\eta \\\\propto {f}_{0}\\\\cdot {\\\\rm{\\\\Delta }}t\\\\cdot {{\\\\rm{\\\\Omega }}}^{-0.45}\\\\cdot {L}^{-0.45}, so one could enhance the constraint on \\u03b7 by one order of magnitude by lowering the detection flux threshold by 10 times, using a 10 times shorter timescale, or increasing the FOV or survey duration by 158 times (15 times if using \\u03b11).Nonetheless, there may be reasons to also require large FOVs or survey areas. If counterpart events are rare in the local universe, a significant number of nearby galaxies would need to be included in a blind search. 6. ConclusionsWe have developed and demonstrated a technique to estimate \\u03b7\\u2014the ratio between the energy emitted by the multiwavelength counterparts of FRBs and FRBs themselves\\u2014by combining existing multiwavelength fast transient surveys with the fluence distribution of the FRB population. The extremely large FOVs and observation durations of surveys from the optical to the TeV bands, combined with the high all-sky rate of FRBs, mean that the locations of several FRBs undetected by radio telescopes have likely been observed by telescopes across the electromagnetic spectrum. We use the properties of several multiwavelength surveys (listed in Table 1) to constrain \\u03b7 under the assumption that no FRB counterparts have been detected and, in some cases, to estimate \\u03b7 under the assumption that all unclassified transient events are FRB counterparts (Table 2 and Figure 1). We conclude the following:1.  Even our most conservative constraints/estimates for \\u03b7 are lower than several existing results, which are largely based on targeted observations of known FRB locations, coordinated between multiple telescopes.2.  The FRB models proposed by Metzger et al. (2019) and Beloborodov (2019), which involve synchrotron masers initiated by shocks driven by young-magnetar flares, are closest to our constraints on \\u03b7. In some scenarios, Gaia should have already detected several FRB counterparts. FRB counterparts may be found among unclassified transient events. This demonstrates the power of our technique to address FRB model predictions. However, in the high-energy bands, surveys by the Fermi and Swift satellites are not likely to have detected FRB counterparts unless the photon indices are significantly steeper than \\u22122.3.  Our technique can also be used to test predictions for multiwavelength emission that is associated with but not directly caused by FRBs. For example, we find evidence that the volumetric rate of magnetar giant flares that emit a factor of \\u03b7 = 107 larger energies in \\u03b3-rays than FRBs do in the radio band is over an order of magnitude higher than the FRB volumetric rate (Section 5.1.3).4.  The apparent rarity of multiwavelength FRB counterparts, and correspondingly likely low values of \\u03b7, implies that future multiwavelength surveys are likely to only detect counterparts to the brightest FRBs. Given the steepness of the FRB fluence distribution at the bright end (James et al. 2019), future blind surveys searching for FRB counterparts should prioritize sensitivity, and the ability to probe appropriately short timescales, over FOV and survey duration. Although our results are robust to uncertainties in the FRB fluence distribution, the future application of our technique to better constrain FRB models will require a careful analysis of unclassified transient events in existing survey data sets. In addition, we assume a homogeneous population of FRB sources, which may not be the case, and it is also possible that some (e.g., soft X-ray, or blue optical) FRB counterparts are absorbed or scattered in dense surrounding media. Multiwavelength observations of nearby individual sources (e.g., Casentini et al. 2020; Pilia et al. 2020; Tavani et al. 2020) are a complementary means to address the nature of the FRB engine and emission mechanism.

The apparent rarity of multiwavelength FRB counterparts, and correspondingly likely low values of \u03b7, implies that future multiwavelength surveys are likely to only detect counterparts to the brightest FRBs. Given the steepness of the FRB fluence distribution at the bright end (James et al. 2019), future blind surveys searching for FRB counterparts should prioritize sensitivity, and the ability to probe appropriately short timescales, over FOV and survey duration.\n\nAlthough our results are robust to uncertainties in the FRB fluence distribution, the future application of our technique to better constrain FRB models will require a careful analysis of unclassified transient events in existing survey data sets. In addition, we assume a homogeneous population of FRB sources, which may not be the case, and it is also possible that some (e.g., soft X-ray, or blue optical) FRB counterparts are absorbed or scattered in dense surrounding media. Multiwavelength observations of nearby individual sources (e.g., Casentini et al. 2020; Pilia et al. 2020; Tavani et al. 2020) are a complementary means to address the nature of the FRB engine and emission mechanism.\n\nWe thank Sterl Phinney and Casey Law for useful discussions.
