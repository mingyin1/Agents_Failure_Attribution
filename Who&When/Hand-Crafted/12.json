Your answer should be a numerical integer value.\n\n\nTo answer this request we have assembled the following team:\n\nAssistant: A helpful and general-purpose AI assistant that has strong language skills, Python skills, and Linux command line skills.\nComputerTerminal: A computer terminal that performs no other action than running Python scripts (provided to it quoted in ```python code blocks), or sh shell scripts (provided to it quoted in ```sh code blocks)\nFileSurfer: An agent that can handle local files.\nWebSurfer: A helpful assistant with access to a web browser. Ask them to perform web searches, open pages, and interact with content (e.g., clicking links, scrolling the viewport, etc., filling in form fields, etc.) It can also summarize the entire page, or answer questions based on the content of the page. It can also be asked to sleep and wait for pages to load, in cases where the pages seem to be taking a while to load.\n\n\n\nHere is an initial fact sheet to consider:\n\n1. GIVEN OR VERIFIED FACTS\n- The request is asking for a comparison between two top 10 lists: worldwide box office and domestic box office for the year 2020, specifically from Box Office Mojo.\n\n2. FACTS TO LOOK UP\n- Box Office Mojo's 2020 Worldwide Box Office top 10 highest-grossing movies.\n- Box Office Mojo's 2020 Domestic Box Office top 10 highest-grossing movies.\n\n3. FACTS TO DERIVE\n- The number of movies appearing in both the worldwide top 10 and the domestic top 10 lists.\n\n4. EDUCATED GUESSES\n- None, as the accurate data will be obtained from the specified source, Box Office Mojo.\n\n\nHere is the plan to follow as best as possible:\n\nHere is a short bullet-point plan for addressing the original request:\n\n1. **Assign WebSurfer to gather data:**\n   - Use WebSurfer to navigate to Box Office Mojo and find the top 10 highest-grossing worldwide movies of 2020.\n   - Use WebSurfer to find the top 10 highest-grossing domestic (U.S.) movies of 2020 on Box Office Mojo.\n   \n2. **Compare the lists:**\n   - Compare the movies from both lists to determine the number of movies that appear in both the worldwide top 10 and the domestic top 10.\n\n3. **Provide the result:**\n   - Report the numerical integer value of how many movies appear in both top 10 lists.\n\nThis plan utilizes WebSurfer's capability to navigate and extract information from web sources effectively. Once the data is collected, a simple comparison can be made to derive the answer.\n\n\n/usr/local/lib/python3.11/site-packages/autogen_magentic_one/agents/orchestrator.py:216: UserWarning: Resolved model mismatch: gpt-4o-2024-08-06 != gpt-4o-2024-05-13.
