Ask them to perform web searches, open pages, and interact with content (e.g., clicking links, scrolling the viewport, etc., filling in form fields, etc.) It can also summarize the entire page, or answer questions based on the content of the page. It can also be asked to sleep and wait for pages to load, in cases where the pages seem to be taking a while to load.\n\n\nHere is an initial fact sheet to consider:\n\n1. GIVEN OR VERIFIED FACTS\n- The location for investigation is within 5 miles by car of the Mothman Museum in West Virginia.\n- \"Gyms\" are specified as the type of establishment being inquired about, with a clear exclusion of gymnastics centers.\n\n2. FACTS TO LOOK UP\n- The exact address or coordinates of the Mothman Museum in West Virginia.\n- Lists or directories of gyms within the specified area (e.g., Google Maps, Yelp, gym locator websites).\n- Maps or navigation tools to determine distances by car from the Mothman Museum.\n\n3. FACTS TO DERIVE\n- Using the location data and navigation tools, derive the specific gyms that fall within the 5-mile driving distance of the Mothman Museum.\n- Verify that these gyms are indeed fitness centers and not gymnastics centers.\n\n4. EDUCATED GUESSES\n- The Mothman Museum is located in Point Pleasant, WV, so the search area will be around this town.\n- Typical gyms that might be found in such an area may include local fitness centers, franchises (such as Anytime Fitness, Planet Fitness), and community recreation centers.\n\n\nHere is the plan to follow as best as possible:\n\nHere's the plan to address the original request:\n\n1. **WebSurfer**:\n   - Look up the exact address or coordinates of the Mothman Museum in Point Pleasant, West Virginia.\n   - Search for gyms within a 5-mile driving distance from the Mothman Museum using online map tools or directories (e.g., Google Maps, Yelp).\n\n2. **Assistant**:\n   - Once WebSurfer provides the list of gyms, Assistant will verify that these gyms are fitness centers and not gymnastics centers by checking their descriptions and services offered.\n\n### Detailed Steps:\n1. WebSurfer will find the precise location of the Mothman Museum.\n2. WebSurfer will search for gyms within 5 miles of the Mothman Museum.\n3. WebSurfer will provide a list of these gyms along with their locations.\n4. Assistant will review the list of gyms to confirm they are fitness centers and not gymnastics centers.\n\nLet's start by having WebSurfer find the exact location of the Mothman Museum.",
