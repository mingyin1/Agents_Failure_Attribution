            "content": "Initial plan:\n\nWe are working to address the following user request:\n\nWhere can I take martial arts classes within a five-minute walk from the New York Stock Exchange after work (7-9 pm)?\n\n\nTo answer this request we have assembled the following team:\n\nAssistant: A helpful and general-purpose AI assistant that has strong language skills, Python skills, and Linux command line skills.\nComputerTerminal: A computer terminal that performs no other action than running Python scripts (provided to it quoted in ```python code blocks), or sh shell scripts (provided to it quoted in ```sh code blocks)\nFileSurfer: An agent that can handle local files.\nWebSurfer: A helpful assistant with access to a web browser. Ask them to perform web searches, open pages, and interact with content (e.g., clicking links, scrolling the viewport, etc., filling in form fields, etc.) It can also summarize the entire page, or answer questions based on the content of the page. It can also be asked to sleep and wait for pages to load, in cases where the pages seem to be taking a while to load.\n\n\n\nHere is an initial fact sheet to consider:\n\n1. GIVEN OR VERIFIED FACTS\n- The user is looking for martial arts classes.\n- The location is within a five-minute walk from the New York Stock Exchange.\n- The preferred time for classes is after work, specifically between 7-9 pm.\n\n2. FACTS TO LOOK UP\n- Martial arts schools or classes available near the New York Stock Exchange.\n- The walkable distance from the New York Stock Exchange.\n- The schedule of classes offered by these martial arts schools or studios in the specified time frame (7-9 pm).\n- Reviews or reputations of the martial arts schools or classes.\n\n3. FACTS TO DERIVE\n- Exact locations and addresses of the martial arts schools to ensure they are within a five-minute walk.\n- The typical walking speed and distance that corresponds to a five-minute walk in city conditions.\n- Mode of public transportation in case the exact walking distance slightly exceeds five minutes but is within reasonable travel time.\n\n4. EDUCATED GUESSES\n- There are likely to be several martial arts schools or studios in the Financial District given its dense business and residential presence.\n- Many fitness studios, including those offering martial arts, might have evening classes catering to professionals finishing work.\n- High propensity for well-established fitness franchises or prestigious individual studios in such a commercial area.\n\n\nHere is the plan to follow as best as possible:\n\nSure, here's a short bullet-point plan for addressing the original request:\n\n1. **Search for Martial Arts Schools:**\n   - Ask WebSurfer to search for martial arts schools or studios near the New York Stock Exchange.\n\n2. **Verify Proximity:**\n   - Confirm that these martial arts schools are within a five-minute walk from the New York Stock Exchange by checking their addresses.\n   - Use an online map to calculate walking time from the New York Stock Exchange to each identified school.\n\n3. **Check Class Schedules:**\n   - Look up the class schedules on the martial arts schools' websites to ensure they have classes between 7-9 pm.\n\n4. **Gather Additional Details:**\n   - Collect any available reviews or ratings for these schools to help determine their reputability and quality of instruction.\n\n5. **Compile Results:**\n   - Summarize the findings, including the names and addresses of suitable martial arts schools, their schedules, and any relevant reviews or ratings.\n\nGiven that this primarily involves web searches, verification of walking distance, and checking schedules, WebSurfer will be primarily involved in this task.\n\n/usr/local/lib/python3.11/site-packages/autogen_magentic_one/agents/orchestrator.py:216: UserWarning: Resolved model mismatch: gpt-4o-2024-08-06 != gpt-4o-2024-05-13.
