Ask them to perform web searches, open pages, and interact with content (e.g., clicking links, scrolling the viewport, etc., filling in form fields, etc.) It can also summarize the entire page, or answer questions based on the content of the page. It can also be asked to sleep and wait for pages to load, in cases where the pages seem to be taking a while to load.\n\n\n\nHere is an initial fact sheet to consider:\n\n1. GIVEN OR VERIFIED FACTS\n- Location: Tompkins Square Park\n- Distance: Within 200 meters\n- Requirement: Gyms with fitness classes before 7am\n\n2. FACTS TO LOOK UP\n- Names and addresses of gyms within 200 meters of Tompkins Square Park\n- Schedules of fitness classes for these gyms, specifically noting any classes that start before 7am\n\n3. FACTS TO DERIVE\n- Proximity of gyms to Tompkins Square Park to verify they are within 200 meters\n- Opening hours of gyms around Tompkins Square Park\n\n4. EDUCATED GUESSES\n- Based on common gym schedules, gyms that operate 24/7 or open very early in the morning are more likely to offer classes before 7am. \n- Larger chain gyms are more likely to have a broader class schedule that includes early morning slots.\n\n\nHere is the plan to follow as best as possible:\n\n### Plan for Addressing the Request:\n\n1. **Identify Gyms Near Tompkins Square Park:**\n    - **WebSurfer:** Perform a web search to identify gyms within 200 meters of Tompkins Square Park.\n    - **WebSurfer:** Verify the addresses of these gyms to ensure they are within the 200m radius.\n\n2. **Check Gym Schedules:**\n    - **WebSurfer:** Look up the schedules for the identified gyms to determine if they have any fitness classes before 7am.\n    - **WebSurfer:** Compile a list of gyms that offer fitness classes before 7am.\n\n3. **Summarize Findings:**\n    - **Assistant:** Organize the findings in a clear and concise manner, listing gyms and their respective early morning class times. \n\nWould you like to proceed with this plan or make any adjustments?\n\n/usr/local/lib/python3.11/site-packages/autogen_magentic_one/agents/orchestrator.py:216: UserWarning: Resolved model mismatch: gpt-4o-2024-08-06 != gpt-4o-2024-05-13.
