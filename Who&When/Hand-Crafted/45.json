Ask them to perform web searches, open pages, and interact with content (e.g., clicking links, scrolling the viewport, etc., filling in form fields, etc.) It can also summarize the entire page, or answer questions based on the content of the page. It can also be asked to sleep and wait for pages to load, in cases where the pages seem to be taking a while to load.\n\n\n\nHere is an initial fact sheet to consider:\n\n1. GIVEN OR VERIFIED FACTS\n- The PowerPoint presentation contains 8 slides.\n- Slide 2: crayfish\n- Slide 3: nematodes\n- Slide 4: isopods\n- Slide 5: eels\n- Slide 6: Yeti crab\n- Slide 7: Spider crab\n- Slide 8: jellyfish\n\n2. FACTS TO LOOK UP\nNone.\n\n3. FACTS TO DERIVE\n- Identify which of the listed animals are classified as crustaceans.\n\n4. EDUCATED GUESSES\n- Crayfish, Yeti crab, and Spider crab are likely to be classified as crustaceans.\n\n\nHere is the plan to follow as best as possible:\n\nHere is a short bullet-point plan for addressing the original request:\n\n1. Use FileSurfer to read the file contents of 'a3fbeb63-0e8c-4a11-bff6-0e3b484c3e9c.pptx' and confirm the slide contents mentioned in the request.\n2. Use WebSurfer to verify if \"crayfish,\" \"isopods,\" \"Yeti crab,\" and \"Spider crab\" are classified as crustaceans.\n3. Count the number of slides that mention crustaceans based on the verified classifications.\n\nBy following this plan, we should be able to determine how many slides in the PowerPoint presentation mention crustaceans.\n\n/usr/local/lib/python3.11/site-packages/autogen_magentic_one/agents/orchestrator.py:216: UserWarning: Resolved model mismatch: gpt-4o-2024-08-06 != gpt-4o-2024-05-13.
