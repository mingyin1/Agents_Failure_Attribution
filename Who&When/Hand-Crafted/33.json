Ask them to perform web searches, open pages, and interact with content (e.g., clicking links, scrolling the viewport, etc., filling in form fields, etc.) It can also summarize the entire page, or answer questions based on the content of the page. It can also be asked to sleep and wait for pages to load, in cases where the pages seem to be taking a while to load.\n\n\n\nHere is an initial fact sheet to consider:\n\n1. GIVEN OR VERIFIED FACTS\n- The request concerns articles under DDC 633 on Bielefeld University Library's BASE as of 2020.\n- There is a mention of an unknown language article with a flag unique from the others.\n- The given time reference is the year 2020.\n\n2. FACTS TO LOOK UP\n- A list of articles under DDC 633 on Bielefeld University Library's BASE as of 2020.\n- The languages and associated flags of the articles under DDC 633 on Bielefeld University Library's BASE.\n- Which country the unique flag belongs to.\n\n3. FACTS TO DERIVE\n- Determining which flag is unique compared to others.\n- Determining which language corresponds to the unique flag.\n\n4. EDUCATED GUESSES\n- Considering Bielefeld University Library's extensive international catalog, the unique language might belong to a less frequently represented country in academic databases.\n- The unique flag could potentially belong to a country with a smaller population or a more unusual academic presence.\n\n\nHere is the plan to follow as best as possible:\n\nHere's a short bullet-point plan for addressing the original request:\n\n1. Use the WebSurfer to navigate to Bielefeld University Library's BASE and locate the section relevant to DDC 633 as of 2020.\n2. Identify and document the languages and flags associated with the articles listed under this section.\n3. Determine which flag among these does not match the others.\n4. Identify the country associated with this unique flag.\n5. Verify the findings to conclusively determine the country from which the unknown language article originates.\n\nTeam assignment:\n- Assign WebSurfer to perform steps 1 through 4.\n- If needed, use Assistant to validate and cross-reference information.\n\nLet's proceed with this plan by initiating it with WebSurfer.\n\n/usr/local/lib/python3.11/site-packages/autogen_magentic_one/agents/orchestrator.py:216: UserWarning: Resolved model mismatch: gpt-4o-2024-08-06 != gpt-4o-2024-05-13.
