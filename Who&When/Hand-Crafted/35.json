Ask them to perform web searches, open pages, and interact with content (e.g., clicking links, scrolling the viewport, etc., filling in form fields, etc.) It can also summarize the entire page, or answer questions based on the content of the page. It can also be asked to sleep and wait for pages to load, in cases where the pages seem to be taking a while to load.\n\n\n\nHere is an initial fact sheet to consider:\n\n1. GIVEN OR VERIFIED FACTS\n- Planned to visit California's Great America once a month in June, July, August, and September during the summer of 2024.\n\n2. FACTS TO LOOK UP\n- The price of a season pass for California's Great America in 2024.\n- The price of a daily ticket for California's Great America in 2024.\n\n3. FACTS TO DERIVE\n- The total cost of daily tickets for four visits.\n- The difference between the cost of the season pass and the total cost of four daily tickets.\n\n4. EDUCATED GUESSES\n- The prices for season passes and daily tickets might be available on the official California's Great America website or through official ticket vendors. \n- Historically, a season pass often costs less than the total cost of several daily tickets if visiting multiple times.\n\n\nHere is the plan to follow as best as possible:\n\nHere is the plan to address the original request:\n\n1. **WebSurfer**: \n   - Look up the price of a season pass for California's Great America in 2024.\n   - Look up the price of a daily ticket for California's Great America in 2024.\n\n2. **Assistant**:\n   - Calculate the total cost of daily tickets for four visits using the daily ticket price.\n   - Calculate the cost difference between the season pass and the total cost of four daily tickets.\n\n3. **Assistant**:\n   - Report the amount saved by purchasing the season pass instead of daily tickets.\n\nLet's proceed with the first step by involving WebSurfer to look up the necessary ticket prices.\n\n/usr/local/lib/python3.11/site-packages/autogen_magentic_one/agents/orchestrator.py:216: UserWarning: Resolved model mismatch: gpt-4o-2024-08-06 != gpt-4o-2024-05-13.

Ask them to perform web searches, open pages, and interact with content (e.g., clicking links, scrolling the viewport, etc., filling in form fields, etc.) It can also summarize the entire page, or answer questions based on the content of the page. It can also be asked to sleep and wait for pages to load, in cases where the pages seem to be taking a while to load.\n\n\n\nHere is an initial fact sheet to consider:\n\n**Updated Fact Sheet:**\n\n1. **GIVEN OR VERIFIED FACTS**\n- Planned to visit California's Great America once a month in June, July, August, and September during the summer of 2024.\n- The 2025 Gold Season Pass costs $99 and includes unlimited visits and free parking for both the 2024 and 2025 seasons, including special events like WinterFest.\n\n2. **FACTS TO LOOK UP**\n- The price of a 2024 season pass for California's Great America (if different from the 2025 Gold Pass).\n- The price of a regular daily ticket for California's Great America in 2024 (excluding discounts and promotions).\n\n3. **FACTS TO DERIVE**\n- The total cost of daily tickets for four visits in 2024.\n- The difference between the cost of the season pass (or the Gold Pass) and the total cost of four daily tickets.\n\n4. **EDUCATED GUESSES**\n- The information about the 2024 season pass and daily ticket prices might be found under the respective sections on California's Great America official website.\n- Historically, a season pass often costs less than the total cost of purchasing multiple daily tickets if planning multiple visits.\n- Considering the special offer for the 2025 Gold Pass (which includes free parking and special event access), it is likely a good value for frequent visitors in 2024.\n\n**Reasoning for Updates:**\n- The 2025 Gold Season Pass price was found ($99) and includes access for the 2024 season.\n- To accurately calculate savings, it is essential to compare this pass to the 2024 daily tickets' prices.\n- Updated guesses emphasize the likelihood of finding definitive prices on the official California's Great America website and highlight the potential cost benefits.\n\n---\n\nNext steps should involve verifying the specific 2024 daily ticket price and confirming if the 2025 Gold Pass includes all relevant benefits for 2024.\n\n\nHere is the plan to follow as best as possible:\n\n**Root Cause of Failure:**\nThe root cause of the failure was the inability to locate and verify specific prices for the 2024 season pass and daily tickets on the California's Great America website, leading to repeated steps and inefficiency.\n\n**New Plan:**\n\n1. **Clarify Requirements:**\n   - Confirm that we need the 2024 season pass price and the regular daily ticket price for 2024 (excluding discounts and promotions).\n\n2. **WebSurfer:**\n   - Directly visit the official California's Great America webpage for season passes.\n   - Look for explicit mentions of the 2024 season pass price, ensuring to double-check if the 2025 Gold Pass includes the 2024 benefits.\n   - Capture complete screenshots or gather all pricing details available on the page before moving on.\n   - Summarize findings with exact prices for the season pass and daily tickets.\n\n3. **WebSurfer:**\n   - Visit the official California's Great America webpage for daily tickets.\n   - Look for the standard daily ticket price for 2024 (standard, single entry, excluding any special events or promotions).\n   - Capture complete screenshots or gather all relevant pricing details from the page before moving on.\n   - Summarize findings with the exact regular daily ticket price.\n\n4. **Assistant:**\n   - Use the collected data to calculate the total cost for four visits using daily tickets.\n   - Compare this with the season pass cost (or the relevant pass with 2024 benefits).\n   - Determine the savings by choosing the season pass over the daily tickets.\n\n5. **Final Report:**\n   - Clearly report the findings: the prices of the 2024 season pass and daily tickets, the total cost difference, and the amount saved by purchasing a season pass.\n\n**Note:** Ensure clarity and completeness of price information during each step to avoid repeated searches and inefficiencies.",
