Ask them to perform web searches, open pages, and interact with content (e.g., clicking links, scrolling the viewport, etc., filling in form fields, etc.) It can also summarize the entire page, or answer questions based on the content of the page. It can also be asked to sleep and wait for pages to load, in cases where the pages seem to be taking a while to load.\n\n\n\nHere is an initial fact sheet to consider:\n\n1. GIVEN OR VERIFIED FACTS\n   - There are no specific facts or figures given in the request itself.\n\n2. FACTS TO LOOK UP\n   - The year the American Alligator was first found west of Texas according to the USGS. This information can likely be found on the USGS (United States Geological Survey) website or in their published reports or databases.\n\n3. FACTS TO DERIVE\n   - None in this context.\n\n4. EDUCATED GUESSES\n   - None at this stage, as the main fact needed is explicitly to be looked up from a reliable source.\n\n\nHere is the plan to follow as best as possible:\n\n- Ask WebSurfer to navigate to the USGS (United States Geological Survey) website.\n- Instruct WebSurfer to use the search function on the USGS website to find information related to the discovery of the American Alligator west of Texas.\n- If necessary, WebSurfer can perform a broader web search if the specific information is not readily found on the USGS site.\n- Once the relevant information is found, WebSurfer will provide a summary or the specific year when the American Alligator was first found west of Texas (not including Texas).\n\n/usr/local/lib/python3.11/site-packages/autogen_magentic_one/agents/orchestrator.py:216: UserWarning: Resolved model mismatch: gpt-4o-2024-08-06 != gpt-4o-2024-05-13.

American alligators can be distinguished from Crocodylus acutus, the American crocodile, and Caiman crocodilus, common caiman, by the presence of a broad, rounded snout, without conspicuous teeth protruding while the mouth is closed (especially the lower 4th tooth) (Behler and King, 1979; Conant and Collins, 1998; Powell et al., 1998). Unlike C. crocodilus, alligators lack a prominent bony ridge in front of and between the eyes (Behler and King, 1979; Conant and Collins, 1998; Powell et al., 1998). See the species accounts titled \u201cCrocodylus acutus (Cuvier, 1807)\u201d and \u201cCaiman crocodilus (Linnaeus, 1758)\u201d on this website for comparison.
