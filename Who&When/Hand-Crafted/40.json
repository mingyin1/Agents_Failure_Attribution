Ask them to perform web searches, open pages, and interact with content (e.g., clicking links, scrolling the viewport, etc., filling in form fields, etc.) It can also summarize the entire page, or answer questions based on the content of the page. It can also be asked to sleep and wait for pages to load, in cases where the pages seem to be taking a while to load.\n\n\n\nHere is an initial fact sheet to consider:\n\n1. GIVEN OR VERIFIED FACTS\n- The request is looking for the smallest house based on square footage.\n- The house must have at least 2 beds and 2 baths.\n- The house must have been sold in Prince Edward Island.\n- The time frame for the house sale is between June 1, 2022, and May 15, 2024.\n- Zillow is the specified source for this information.\n\n2. FACTS TO LOOK UP\n- The specific house in Prince Edward Island that meets the criteria from the Zillow database.\n\n3. FACTS TO DERIVE\n- Identification of the smallest house by square footage from the Zillow data, based on the given criteria.\n\n4. EDUCATED GUESSES\n- It's unlikely that the smallest house with 2 beds and 2 baths will be exceptionally large, given that smaller homes are typically more common. This would likely fall within the range of 800-1200 square feet.\n\n\nHere is the plan to follow as best as possible:\n\nHere is the plan to address the original request:\n\n1. **WebSurfer**:\n   - Perform a search for the Zillow listings and sales data for houses in Prince Edward Island.\n   - Filter the search results to find houses that have at least 2 beds and 2 baths.\n   - Further filter the results to focus on sales that occurred between June 1, 2022, and May 15, 2024.\n   - Identify and record the details of the smallest house based on square footage that fits the criteria.\n\n2. **Assistant**:\n   - Synthesize and verify the information provided by WebSurfer to ensure accuracy.\n   - Provide a summary of findings.\n\n### Next steps:\n1. Instruct WebSurfer to search Zillow for the relevant data.\n2. Analyze the data provided by WebSurfer once the data has been collected. \n\nLet's start with step 1. Shall we proceed?\n\n/usr/local/lib/python3.11/site-packages/autogen_magentic_one/agents/orchestrator.py:216: UserWarning: Resolved model mismatch: gpt-4o-2024-08-06 != gpt-4o-2024-05-13.
