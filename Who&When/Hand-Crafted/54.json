Give them to me in the form Pitcher Before, Pitcher After, use their last names only, in Roman characters.\n\n\nTo answer this request we have assembled the following team:\n\nAssistant: A helpful and general-purpose AI assistant that has strong language skills, Python skills, and Linux command line skills.\nComputerTerminal: A computer terminal that performs no other action than running Python scripts (provided to it quoted in ```python code blocks), or sh shell scripts (provided to it quoted in ```sh code blocks)\nFileSurfer: An agent that can handle local files.\nWebSurfer: A helpful assistant with access to a web browser. Ask them to perform web searches, open pages, and interact with content (e.g., clicking links, scrolling the viewport, etc., filling in form fields, etc.) It can also summarize the entire page, or answer questions based on the content of the page. It can also be asked to sleep and wait for pages to load, in cases where the pages seem to be taking a while to load.\n\n\n\nHere is an initial fact sheet to consider:\n\n### 1. GIVEN OR VERIFIED FACTS\n- The request specifies pitchers with the number before and after Taish\u014d Tamai's number as of July 2023.\n- The names should be provided in the format: Pitcher Before, Pitcher After, using their last names in Roman characters.\n\n### 2. FACTS TO LOOK UP\n- Taish\u014d Tamai's jersey number as of July 2023.\n- The roster of the team Taish\u014d Tamai plays for, specifically the jersey numbers of the players surrounding his number.\n\n### 3. FACTS TO DERIVE\n- Determine the players whose jersey numbers are immediately before and after Taish\u014d Tamai's number based on the team roster.\n\n### 4. EDUCATED GUESSES\n- None provided as it requires specific roster details that need to be looked up.\n\n\nHere is the plan to follow as best as possible:\n\nCertainly! Here's a concise plan to address the original request:\n\n### Plan\n1. **Identify Taish\u014d Tamai's Team and Jersey Number**\n   - WebSurfer will look up Taish\u014d Tamai's team and his jersey number as of July 2023.\n   \n2. **Obtain Team Roster**\n   - WebSurfer will find the complete roster of Taish\u014d Tamai's team, including jersey numbers for all players.\n\n3. **Identify Pitchers Before and After**\n   - Using the roster information, determine the pitchers with jersey numbers immediately before and after Taish\u014d Tamai's number.\n\n4. **Provide Results**\n   - Present the last names of the identified pitchers in the format: Pitcher Before, Pitcher After.\n\n### Task Allocation\n- **WebSurfer** will be primarily involved in looking up the relevant information:\n  - Search for Taish\u014d Tamai's team and jersey number.\n  - Find the team roster including all players' jersey numbers.\n\nAssistant will ensure coordination and logical deduction to derive the final results once WebSurfer provides the necessary data.\n\nLet's begin by having **WebSurfer** look up Taish\u014d Tamai's team and jersey number as of July 2023.\n\n/usr/local/lib/python3.11/site-packages/autogen_magentic_one/agents/orchestrator.py:216: UserWarning: Resolved model mismatch: gpt-4o-2024-08-06 != gpt-4o-2024-05-13.
