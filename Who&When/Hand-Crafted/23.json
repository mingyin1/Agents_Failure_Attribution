(The answer should be a json object with the keys \"sender\" and \"price (usd)\")\n\n\nTo answer this request we have assembled the following team:\n\nAssistant: A helpful and general-purpose AI assistant that has strong language skills, Python skills, and Linux command line skills.\nComputerTerminal: A computer terminal that performs no other action than running Python scripts (provided to it quoted in ```python code blocks), or sh shell scripts (provided to it quoted in ```sh code blocks)\nFileSurfer: An agent that can handle local files.\nWebSurfer: A helpful assistant with access to a web browser. Ask them to perform web searches, open pages, and interact with content (e.g., clicking links, scrolling the viewport, etc., filling in form fields, etc.) It can also summarize the entire page, or answer questions based on the content of the page. It can also be asked to sleep and wait for pages to load, in cases where the pages seem to be taking a while to load.\n\n\n\nHere is an initial fact sheet to consider:\n\nHere is the updated fact sheet including new information we have learned and additional educated guesses:\n\n1. GIVEN OR VERIFIED FACTS\n- The item to be mailed is a DVD.\n- The sender is in Hartford, Connecticut.\n- The destination is Colombia.\n- The available shipping services are FedEx, DHL, or USPS.\n- USPS often offers a more economical option compared to private couriers for international mailing of small items.\n\n2. FACTS TO LOOK UP\n- Shipping rates and options for mailing a DVD from Hartford, Connecticut to Colombia using FedEx.\n- Shipping rates and options for mailing a DVD from Hartford, Connecticut to Colombia using DHL.\n- Shipping rates and options for mailing a DVD from Hartford, Connecticut to Colombia using USPS.\n\n3. FACTS TO DERIVE\n- The cheapest shipping option among FedEx, DHL, and USPS based on the gathered shipping rates.\n\n4. EDUCATED GUESSES\n- Considering issues faced with FedEx site navigation, the rate calculation process might be slightly more complex. This complexity can assume higher costs due to additional service and handling.\n- DHL typically offers quicker delivery times but can be more expensive; similar types of shipments (e.g., DVDs to Colombia) are likely to reflect this trend.\n- USPS's First-Class International service may likely offer the least expensive option due to its standardized rates for small, lightweight items like DVDs.\n\n\nHere is the plan to follow as best as possible:\n\n### Root Cause of the Failure:\nThe previous attempts were unsuccessful due to navigation challenges and the complexity of inputting details into the FedEx and USPS websites. Additionally, the focus on FedEx distracted from completing the lookup for USPS and DHL in a timely manner.\n\n### New Plan to Overcome Challenges:\n1. **USPS Lookup**:\n   - **Step 1**: Visit the USPS website.\n   - **Step 2**: Navigate directly to the International Shipping Calculator.\n   - **Step 3**: Input the details for mailing a DVD from Hartford, Connecticut to Colombia.\n   - **Step 4**: Retrieve and note down the shipping rates.\n\n2. **FedEx Lookup**:\n   - **Step 1**: Use previously filled details on FedEx's rate calculator.\n   - **Step 2**: Ensure the dropdown menu selections for \"From\" (Hartford, Connecticut) and \"To\" (Colombia) are completed.\n   - **Step 3**: Complete any remaining required fields (e.g., weight, dimensions).\n   - **Step 4**: Retrieve and note down the shipping rates.\n\n3. **DHL Lookup**:\n   - **Step 1**: Visit the DHL website.\n   - **Step 2**: Navigate to the International Shipping Calculator or Rate Finder.\n   - **Step 3**: Input the details for mailing a DVD from Hartford, Connecticut to Colombia.\n   - **Step 4**: Retrieve and note down the shipping rates.\n\n4. **Comparison**:\n   - **Step 1**: Compare the rates retrieved from USPS, FedEx, and DHL.\n   - **Step 2**: Identify the cheapest option for mailing the DVD to Colombia from Hartford, Connecticut.\n\n5. **JSON Output**:\n   - **Step 1**: Format the derived information into a JSON object with the keys \"sender\" and \"price (usd)\".\n\n### Execution:\n1. Assign **WebSurfer** to start with the USPS rates lookup.\n2. Next, have **WebSurfer** complete the FedEx rates lookup using the provided screenshots and website navigation.\n3. Finally, direct **WebSurfer** to perform the DHL rates lookup.\n4. Obtain the rates and execute the comparison in JSON format.\n\nAssistant, proceed to instruct WebSurfer to look up the USPS shipping rates for mailing a DVD from Hartford, Connecticut to Colombia.",

(The answer should be a json object with the keys \"sender\" and \"price (usd)\")\n\n\nTo answer this request we have assembled the following team:\n\nAssistant: A helpful and general-purpose AI assistant that has strong language skills, Python skills, and Linux command line skills.\nComputerTerminal: A computer terminal that performs no other action than running Python scripts (provided to it quoted in ```python code blocks), or sh shell scripts (provided to it quoted in ```sh code blocks)\nFileSurfer: An agent that can handle local files.\nWebSurfer: A helpful assistant with access to a web browser. Ask them to perform web searches, open pages, and interact with content (e.g., clicking links, scrolling the viewport, etc., filling in form fields, etc.) It can also summarize the entire page, or answer questions based on the content of the page. It can also be asked to sleep and wait for pages to load, in cases where the pages seem to be taking a while to load.\n\n\n\nHere is an initial fact sheet to consider:\n\nHere is the updated fact sheet including new information we have learned and additional educated guesses:\n\n1. GIVEN OR VERIFIED FACTS\n- The item to be mailed is a DVD.\n- The sender is in Hartford, Connecticut.\n- The destination is Colombia.\n- The available shipping services are FedEx, DHL, or USPS.\n- USPS often offers a more economical option compared to private couriers for international mailing of small items.\n- The ZIP code for Hartford, Connecticut (06101) has been determined.\n- We need to input details such as destination country (Colombia), package dimensions (7.5x5.3x0.6 inches), and weight (0.2 lbs) for an accurate postage calculation.\n\n2. FACTS TO LOOK UP\n- Shipping rates and options for mailing a DVD from Hartford, Connecticut to Colombia using FedEx.\n- Shipping rates and options for mailing a DVD from Hartford, Connecticut to Colombia using DHL.\n- Completion of USPS rate lookup using the identified package size, weight, and destination.\n\n3. FACTS TO DERIVE\n- The cheapest shipping option among FedEx, DHL, and USPS based on the gathered shipping rates.\n\n4. EDUCATED GUESSES\n- Considering issues faced with FedEx site navigation, the rate calculation process might be slightly more complex. This complexity can assume higher costs due to additional service and handling.\n- DHL typically offers quicker delivery times but can be more expensive; similar types of shipments (e.g., DVDs to Colombia) are likely to reflect this trend.\n- USPS's First-Class International service may likely offer the least expensive option due to its standardized rates for small, lightweight items like DVDs.\n- Given the same size and weight, USPS's flat rate options may be competitively priced and offer a quick solution for package delivery.\n\nSince we need to further proceed with the USPS rate calculation, I will input the details into the USPS Retail Postage Price Calculator.\n\n\nHere is the plan to follow as best as possible:\n\n### Root Cause of the Failure:\nThe main issue was navigating and entering all the necessary details in the USPS Retail Postage Price Calculator. This challenge was exacerbated by a need for clear, step-by-step instructions to input details and obtain rates accurately.\n\n### New Plan to Overcome Challenges:\n1. **Step-by-step Instructions for USPS Rate Calculation**:\n   - **Input Initial Details**:\n     - Select \"Colombia\" from the destination country dropdown.\n     - Input \"06101\" for the ZIP code from.\n   - **Enter Detailed Package Information**:\n     - Set the package dimensions to 7.5x5.3x0.6 inches.\n     - Set the package weight to 0.2 lbs.\n   - **Retrieve Rates**: Capture the shipping rates from USPS to Colombia.\n\n2. **Automate and Verify Each Step**:\n   - **Verify Destination**: Confirm \"Colombia\" is correctly selected.\n   - **Confirm ZIP Code**: Ensure \"06101\" is input correctly.\n   - **Input Dimensions and Weight**: Provide explicit fields for package size and weight.\n   - **Retrieve Rates**: Ensure the correct shipping rates are captured.\n\n3. **Fallback Strategy**:\n   - **Clear Navigation Plan**: If issues persist, navigate to the specific USPS international shipping rate page to cross-verify rates.\n   - **Browser Interaction**: Utilize WebSurfer capabilities to handle more complex input fields if needed.\n\n4. **Simultaneous Lookup for Other Services**:\n   - **Initiate DHL**: Start the DHL rate lookup to gather information in parallel.\n   - **FedEx Rates**: Use existing details to finalize rate discovery on the FedEx website.\n\n5. **Final JSON Compilation**:\n   - **Compare Rates**: Collect and compare shipping rates from USPS, DHL, and FedEx.\n   - **Output JSON**: Format and present the cheapest option in the requested JSON format: `{\"sender\": \"service_name\", \"price (usd)\": rate}`.\n\nAssistant, proceed to instruct WebSurfer to reattempt the USPS rate calculation for mailing a DVD using detailed instructions. Once that is completed, also initiate the lookup for DHL and FedEx rates.",
