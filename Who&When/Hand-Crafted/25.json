Find the Wikipedia page for the 2019 game that won the British Academy Games Awards. How many revisions did that page have before the month listed as the game's release date on that Wikipedia page (as of the most recent entry from 2022)?\n\n\nTo answer this request we have assembled the following team:\n\nAssistant: A helpful and general-purpose AI assistant that has strong language skills, Python skills, and Linux command line skills.\nComputerTerminal: A computer terminal that performs no other action than running Python scripts (provided to it quoted in ```python code blocks), or sh shell scripts (provided to it quoted in ```sh code blocks)\nFileSurfer: An agent that can handle local files.\nWebSurfer: A helpful assistant with access to a web browser. Ask them to perform web searches, open pages, and interact with content (e.g., clicking links, scrolling the viewport, etc., filling in form fields, etc.) It can also summarize the entire page, or answer questions based on the content of the page. It can also be asked to sleep and wait for pages to load, in cases where the pages seem to be taking a while to load.\n\n\n\nHere is an initial fact sheet to consider:\n\n1. GIVEN OR VERIFIED FACTS\n- The game was released in 2019.\n- It won the British Academy Games Awards.\n\n2. FACTS TO LOOK UP\n- Specific name of the game that won the British Academy Games Awards in 2019 (This can be found on the official British Academy Games Awards website or Wikipedia page).\n- Wikipedia page of the 2019 game to get the release date.\n- The revision history of the Wikipedia page to determine the number of revisions before the release date.\n\n3. FACTS TO DERIVE\n- The total number of revisions on the Wikipedia page before the game\u2019s release date.\n\n4. EDUCATED GUESSES\n- Based on typical release practice, there is likely to be some information and edits leading up to the release of a highly anticipated game.\n\n\nHere is the plan to follow as best as possible:\n\nPlan:\n\n1. **Identify the 2019 British Academy Games Awards winner:**\n    - Utilize the WebSurfer to search for the winner of the 2019 British Academy Games Awards.\n\n2. **Find the Wikipedia page for the identified game:**\n    - Use the WebSurfer to locate the Wikipedia page for the identified game.\n\n3. **Retrieve the release date from the Wikipedia page:**\n    - Obtain the release date of the game from its Wikipedia page.\n\n4. **Access the revision history of the Wikipedia page:**\n    - Utilize the WebSurfer to open the revision history for the game's Wikipedia page.\n\n5. **Count the revisions before the release date:**\n    - Instruct WebSurfer to count the number of revisions from the page\u2019s creation until the release date listed on the Wikipedia page.\n\n6. **Summarize the findings:**\n    - Compile the information regarding the revisions and present the findings.\n\nLet's get started with the first step. \n\n**WebSurfer**, could you please search for the winner of the 2019 British Academy Games Awards?\n\n/usr/local/lib/python3.11/site-packages/autogen_magentic_one/agents/orchestrator.py:216: UserWarning: Resolved model mismatch: gpt-4o-2024-08-06 != gpt-4o-2024-05-13.

It is the eighth installment in the **God of War series** and the sequel to 2010's **God of War III**. For the first time in the series, there are two protagonists: **Kratos**, the former **Greek God of War** who remains the only playable character, and his young son, **Atreus**. Following the death of Kratos's second wife and Atreus's mother, **Faye**, the two embark on a deeply personal journey to fulfill her last wish that her ashes be spread from the highest peak in all the nine realms. Kratos keeps his troubled past a secret from Atreus, who is unaware of his divine nature. Along their journey, they come into conflict with monsters and gods of the Norse world.\n\nUnlike previous games, which were loosely based on **Greek mythology**, this installment is loosely inspired by **Norse mythology**, with the majority of it set in ancient **Scandinavia** in the realm of **Midgard**.\n\nDescribed by creative director **Cory Barlog** as a reimagining of the franchise, a major **gameplay** change is that Kratos makes prominent use of a magical **battle axe**; his signature **double-chained blades** serve as an alternative method of combat. **God of War** also uses an **over-the-shoulder free camera**, with the game in **one shot**, as opposed to the **fixed cinematic camera** of the previous entries. The game also includes **role-playing game** elements, and Kratos's son Atreus provides assistance in combat. The majority of the original game's development team worked on **God of War** and designed it to be accessible and grounded. A separate short **text-based game**, **A Call from the Wilds**, was released in February 2018 through **Facebook Messenger** and follows Atreus on his first adventure. Three days before **God of War\u2019s** release, a smartphone companion app called **Mimir's Vision** was made available, providing additional information about the game's lore.\n\n**God of War**\n\n**Developer(s)**\nSanta Monica Studio[a]\n\n**Publisher(s)**\nSony Interactive Entertainment\n\n**Director(s)**\nCory Barlog\n\n**Producer(s)**\nYumi Yang\nElizabeth Dahm Wang\nSean Llewellyn\nChad Cox\nEric Fong\n\n**Designer(s)**\nDerek Daniels\n\n**Programmer(s)**\nFlorian Strauss\n\n**Writer(s)**\nMatt Sophos\nRichard Zangrande Gaubert\nCory Barlog\n\n**Composer(s)**\nBear McCreary\n\n---\n\n**UI Elements:**\n\n**Contents**\nhide\n\n**(Top)**\nGameplay\nSynopsis\nDevelopment\nRelease\nReception\nSequel\nTelevision series\nNotes\nReferences\nExternal links\n\n---\n\n**Article**\nRead\nEdit\nView history\nTools\n\n---\n\n**Appearance**\nhide\n\nText\nSmall\nStandard\nLarge\n\nWidth\nStandard\nWide\n\nColor (beta)\nAutomatic\nLight\nDark\n<Image>",
