Ask them to perform web searches, open pages, and interact with content (e.g., clicking links, scrolling the viewport, etc., filling in form fields, etc.) It can also summarize the entire page, or answer questions based on the content of the page. It can also be asked to sleep and wait for pages to load, in cases where the pages seem to be taking a while to load.\n\n\n\nHere is an initial fact sheet to consider:\n\n1. GIVEN OR VERIFIED FACTS\n- The movie in question must be a Daniel Craig movie.\n- The movie must be less than 150 minutes long.\n- The movie must be available on Netflix (US).\n- The movie must be highly rated according to IMDB.\n\n2. FACTS TO LOOK UP\n- The IMDB ratings of Daniel Craig movies.\n- The duration (in minutes) of Daniel Craig movies.\n- The availability of Daniel Craig movies on Netflix (US).\n\n3. FACTS TO DERIVE\n- Identify the Daniel Craig movie that meets all the criteria (highest IMDB rating, less than 150 minutes, available on Netflix US).\n\n4. EDUCATED GUESSES\n- Some popular Daniel Craig movies include those in the James Bond series, and movies like \"Knives Out\" and \"The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo\" which might be highly rated.\n- Specific streaming availability would likely change over time, so an educated guess might include recent popular titles that may still be on Netflix.\n\n\nHere is the plan to follow as best as possible:\n\nHere is a short bullet-point plan for addressing the original request:\n\n1. **WebSurfer Task:**\n   - Look up the list of Daniel Craig movies and their corresponding IMDB ratings.\n   - Identify which of these movies are less than 150 minutes long.\n   - Check the availability of these movies on Netflix (US).\n   \n2. **Assistant Task:**\n   - Filter the movies to find the one with the highest IMDB rating that meets the criteria (less than 150 minutes and available on Netflix US).\n\n3. **Verification:**\n   - Verify information accuracy and ensure that all criteria are met.\n\nBy following this plan, we can pinpoint the highest-rated Daniel Craig movie on IMDB that is less than 150 minutes long and available on Netflix (US). I will initiate the tasks with WebSurfer.\n\n/usr/local/lib/python3.11/site-packages/autogen_magentic_one/agents/orchestrator.py:216: UserWarning: Resolved model mismatch: gpt-4o-2024-08-06 != gpt-4o-2024-05-13.
