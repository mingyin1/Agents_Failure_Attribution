Ask them to perform web searches, open pages, and interact with content (e.g., clicking links, scrolling the viewport, etc., filling in form fields, etc.) It can also summarize the entire page, or answer questions based on the content of the page. It can also be asked to sleep and wait for pages to load, in cases where the pages seem to be taking a while to load.\n\n\n\nHere is an initial fact sheet to consider:\n\n1. GIVEN OR VERIFIED FACTS\n- The request involves people in the monday.com C-suite.\n- The focus is on identifying who did not have a C-suite position during the company's IPO.\n\n2. FACTS TO LOOK UP\n- The current C-suite members of monday.com.\n- The specific date of monday.com's IPO.\n- The C-suite members of monday.com at the time of its IPO.\n\n3. FACTS TO DERIVE\n- Comparing the current C-suite members with those at the time of the IPO to determine who was not in a C-suite position during the company's IPO.\n\n4. EDUCATED GUESSES\n- None at this stage.\n\n\nHere is the plan to follow as best as possible:\n\nHere is the short bullet-point plan for addressing the original request:\n\n1. **Identify the current C-suite members of monday.com:**\n    - Utilize WebSurfer to search for the most up-to-date list of C-suite executives at monday.com.\n    \n2. **Determine the IPO date for monday.com:**\n    - Utilize WebSurfer to find the exact date of monday.com's IPO.\n\n3. **Find the C-suite members at the time of monday.com's IPO:**\n    - Utilize WebSurfer to search for historical information on monday.com's C-suite members around the time of the IPO.\n\n4. **Compare lists:**\n    - Collect the names from both periods and compare to identify who did not hold a C-suite position during the IPO.\n\nThis plan primarily involves the use of WebSurfer to gather the necessary information from publicly available resources.\n\n/usr/local/lib/python3.11/site-packages/autogen_magentic_one/agents/orchestrator.py:216: UserWarning: Resolved model mismatch: gpt-4o-2024-08-06 != gpt-4o-2024-05-13.

Ask them to perform web searches, open pages, and interact with content (e.g., clicking links, scrolling the viewport, etc., filling in form fields, etc.) It can also summarize the entire page, or answer questions based on the content of the page. It can also be asked to sleep and wait for pages to load, in cases where the pages seem to be taking a while to load.\n\n\n\nHere is an initial fact sheet to consider:\n\nHere is the updated fact sheet:\n\n1. GIVEN OR VERIFIED FACTS\n- The request involves people in the monday.com C-suite.\n- The focus is on identifying who did not have a C-suite position during the company's IPO.\n- The specific date of monday.com's IPO is June 10, 2021.\n- The current C-suite members of monday.com include Roy Mann, Eran Zinman, Eliran Glazer, and Shiran Nawi.\n\n2. FACTS TO LOOK UP\n- The C-suite members of monday.com at the time of its IPO.\n\n3. FACTS TO DERIVE\n- Comparing the current C-suite members with those at the time of the IPO to determine who was not in a C-suite position during the company's IPO.\n\n4. EDUCATED GUESSES\n- Given that Roy Mann and Eran Zinman are co-founders, they likely held C-suite positions at the time of the IPO.\n- Eliran Glazer or Shiran Nawi might be new additions to the C-suite since the IPO, based only on the fact that they are less likely to be co-founders and may have been hired later.\n\n\nHere is the plan to follow as best as possible:\n\n### Analysis of Failure\nThe root cause of the previous failures was the inability to efficiently retrieve historical data about monday.com's C-suite members from June 2021. Specifically, the web browsing process encountered timeouts and issues navigating to relevant pages.\n\n### New Plan\n1. **Start Fresh with a Targeted Search:**\n   - Use WebSurfer to perform a highly specific search for \"monday.com IPO C-suite members June 2021\" only on trusted business and financial news sites such as Bloomberg, Business Insider, or SEC filings.\n\n2. **Shortened and Specific Steps:**\n   - **Specific Search Queries:** Directly search for articles or press releases around the IPO date of June 10, 2021. Queries like \"monday.com IPO leadership team June 2021\" or \"monday.com IPO C-suite members.\"\n   - **Use Caching:** Check if previous cache records or archives from established financial news websites provide the required data.\n\n3. **Diversify Sources:**\n   - **Financial News Websites:** Search sites like Bloomberg, Business Insider, CNBC, and Reuters.\n   - **SEC Filings:** Search for official filings around the IPO time, which typically list key executives.\n\n4. **Avoid Overloading:**\n   - **Limit Browsing Depth and Time:** Set efficient time limits and avoid deep scrolling to prevent timeouts. Focus on the first few relevant results and carefully check their content.\n\n5. **Grid Approach for Comparisons:**\n   - Once data is obtained, create a comparative chart to cross-reference the C-suite members during the IPO with the current team.\n\nLet's initiate the new plan and ensure better efficiency. \n\n### Execution \nPlease search for business news articles, financial news reports, or SEC filings that specifically list the C-suite members of monday.com around the IPO date (June 10, 2021). Prioritize trusted financial news sources and SEC filings.",

Ask them to perform web searches, open pages, and interact with content (e.g., clicking links, scrolling the viewport, etc., filling in form fields, etc.) It can also summarize the entire page, or answer questions based on the content of the page. It can also be asked to sleep and wait for pages to load, in cases where the pages seem to be taking a while to load.\n\n\n\nHere is an initial fact sheet to consider:\n\nHere is the updated fact sheet:\n\n1. GIVEN OR VERIFIED FACTS\n- The request involves people in the monday.com C-suite.\n- The focus is on identifying who did not have a C-suite position during the company's IPO.\n- The specific date of monday.com's IPO is June 10, 2021.\n- The current C-suite members of monday.com include Roy Mann, Eran Zinman, Eliran Glazer, and Shiran Nawi.\n- Monday.com raised $574 million in their IPO.\n\n2. FACTS TO LOOK UP\n- The C-suite members of monday.com at the time of its IPO.\n- Specific SEC filings or financial news articles listing the C-suite members around June 2021.\n\n3. FACTS TO DERIVE\n- Comparing the current C-suite members with those at the time of the IPO to determine who was not in a C-suite position during the company's IPO.\n\n4. EDUCATED GUESSES\n- Roy Mann and Eran Zinman are co-founders of monday.com and likely held C-suite positions at the time of the IPO.\n- Given that specific mention of other names was not found in the initial sources, Eliran Glazer or Shiran Nawi might be new additions to the C-suite since the IPO.\n- The searches did not return immediate names, so focusing on specific SEC filings or more comprehensive articles from Bloomberg or similar sources may yield further insights.\n\nThe reasoning behind these educated guesses is based on the likelihood that co-founders would have been in key positions at the time of the IPO and less recognized names may have joined after.\n\n\nHere is the plan to follow as best as possible:\n\n### Analysis of Failure\n**Root Cause:** The root cause of the delay was the timeout while navigating the SEC-EDGAR database and extracting IPO filing documents. This issue mainly stems from the complexity of the site's search function and the difficulty in handling dynamic web pages.\n\n### New Plan\n1. **Utilize Web Resources:**\n   - **Targeted Search:** Use more specific and direct search queries on financial news sites like Bloomberg, Business Insider, and CNBC to find historical articles naming monday.com's C-suite members at the time of IPO.\n   - **Multiple Trusted Sources:** Diversify sources to include official SEC filings, press releases, or financial news articles to verify the data.\n\n2. **Efficient Use of Tools:**\n   - **WebSurfer Efficiency:** Limit unnecessary navigation. Focus on precise document extraction.\n   - **Direct Links to Data:** If available, provide specific URLs to documents directly referencing the IPO.\n\n### Steps and/or Hints to Avoid Repeating Mistakes:\n- **Accurate Search Terms:** Use specific terms such as \"monday.com IPO C-suite list June 2021 fortune\" or \"monday.com executives 2021 IPO.\"\n- **Data Extraction:** Extract executive names, positions, and any other relevant information.\n- **Avoid Unresponsive Sites:** If a site is unresponsive or causes delays, immediately pivot to an alternative source with similar credibility.\n\n### Execution\n1. **Specific Financial Sites:**\n   - Search for articles from financial news websites that reported on monday.com's IPO, focusing on the executive team at the time of IPO.\n   \n2. **Use Trusted Business Websites:**\n   - Go directly to Bloomberg, Business Insider, Reuters, or CNBC.\n   - Use keywords such as \"monday.com C-suite members June 2021 IPO.\"\n\n3. **Official Sources Search:**\n   - Look up SEC filings of monday.com around June 2021 on the SEC website.\n   - Focus on extracting data from Form S-1 or similar relevant documents.\n\n### Coordination and Tools\n- Assign WebSurfer to handle precise search and data extraction from trusted sources.\n- If needed, bring in FileSurfer to handle local document analysis if relevant data is found.\n   \nBy following this new plan, the time spent on ineffective searches will be minimized and the likelihood of finding precise information efficiently will be increased.",

Ask them to perform web searches, open pages, and interact with content (e.g., clicking links, scrolling the viewport, etc., filling in form fields, etc.) It can also summarize the entire page, or answer questions based on the content of the page. It can also be asked to sleep and wait for pages to load, in cases where the pages seem to be taking a while to load.\n\n\n\nHere is an initial fact sheet to consider:\n\n### Updated Fact Sheet\n\n1. GIVEN OR VERIFIED FACTS\n- The request involves people in the monday.com C-suite.\n- The focus is on identifying who did not have a C-suite position during the company's IPO.\n- The specific date of monday.com's IPO is June 10, 2021.\n- The current C-suite members of monday.com include Roy Mann, Eran Zinman, Eliran Glazer, and Shiran Nawi.\n- Monday.com raised $574 million in their IPO.\n\n2. FACTS TO LOOK UP\n- The C-suite members of monday.com at the time of its IPO.\n- Specific SEC filings or financial news articles listing the C-suite members around June 2021.\n\n3. FACTS TO DERIVE\n- Comparing the current C-suite members with those at the time of the IPO to determine who was not in a C-suite position during the company's IPO.\n\n4. EDUCATED GUESSES\n- Roy Mann and Eran Zinman are co-founders of monday.com and likely held C-suite positions at the time of the IPO.\n- Given that specific mention of other names was not found in the initial sources, Eliran Glazer or Shiran Nawi might be new additions to the C-suite since the IPO.\n- Educated guess: Eliran Glazer might be a new addition to the C-suite since the IPO because C-suite positions, like CFO, often see changes post-IPO due to the company's evolving needs and strategies.\n- Educated guess: Shiran Nawi might also be a new addition. The name does not appear in historically verified articles around the IPO date, which might indicate a post-IPO appointment. \n\nThe reasoning behind these educated guesses is based on the likelihood that co-founders would have been in key positions at the time of the IPO and less recognized names may have joined after. Additionally, strategic roles like CFO are often re-evaluated as companies transition from private to public.\n\n\nHere is the plan to follow as best as possible:\n\n### Root Cause Analysis\nThe primary issue was a series of misclicks and incorrect navigation on the web pages, which led to not accessing the specific targeted information about the monday.com C-suite at the time of the IPO. This resulted in a failure to extract the necessary data and answer the user's query.\n\n### New Plan to Overcome Challenges\n1. **Target Specific Sources**:\n   - **Focus on Targeted Articles**: Specifically search for and open articles that discuss monday.com’s IPO in June 2021 from reliable sources like Bloomberg, Business Insider, SEC filings, or monday.com’s official site.\n  \n2. **Efficient Use of WebSurfer**:\n   - **Precise Searches**: Use precise search queries like \"monday.com C-suite executives June 2021 IPO\" or \"monday.com IPO June 2021 leadership team\" to locate specific articles or press releases.\n   - **Direct Navigation**: Click only on links that have a high probability of containing the required information. Avoid general links or unrelated articles.\n\n3. **Extracting Data from SEC Filings**:\n   - Navigate directly to the SEC EDGAR database and search for \"monday.com S-1 filing\". The S-1 filing will contain detailed information about the executive team at the time of the IPO.\n\n4. **Cross-Referencing Information**:\n   - Cross-reference data obtained from news articles with the SEC filings or official press releases to ensure accuracy.\n\n### Execution Steps:\n1. **Perform Targeted Web Search**:\n   - **WebSurfer**: Perform a web search using specific keywords like “monday.com S-1 filing June 2021” or \"monday.com IPO Executive Team\".\n\n2. **Click on Reliable Sources**:\n   - **WebSurfer**: Click on sources like Bloomberg, Business Insider, or official monday.com press releases directly related to the IPO executive team.\n\n3. **Access SEC Filings**:\n   - **WebSurfer**: Navigate to the SEC EDGAR database and locate monday.com's S-1 filing from June 2021.\n\n4. **Data Extraction**:\n   - **WebSurfer**: Extract names and positions of the C-suite members listed in the S-1 filing and relevant news articles.\n  \n5. **Compare and Validate**:\n   - **Assistant**: Compare the current C-suite list with the extracted 2021 IPO C-suite list to identify any new additions or changes.\n\nBy following these steps, we can efficiently and effectively extract the necessary information and avoid repetitive and unproductive navigation.",
