Ask them to perform web searches, open pages, and interact with content (e.g., clicking links, scrolling the viewport, etc., filling in form fields, etc.) It can also summarize the entire page, or answer questions based on the content of the page. It can also be asked to sleep and wait for pages to load, in cases where the pages seem to be taking a while to load.\n\n\n\nHere is an initial fact sheet to consider:\n\n1. GIVEN OR VERIFIED FACTS\n- In Tizin, basic sentences are arranged with the Verb first, followed by the direct object, followed by the subject of the sentence.\n- The word that indicates oneself in the nominative form is \"Pa,\" in the accusative form is \"Mato,\" and in the genitive form is \"Sing.\"\n- The root verb that indicates an intense like for something is \"Maktay.\" In the present tense, it is \"Maktay,\" in the preterit past, it is \"Tay,\" and in the imperfect past, it is \"Aktay.\"\n- The verb \"Maktay\" is used differently than in English and is better translated as \"is pleasing to,\" meaning that the thing doing the liking is actually the object of the sentence.\n- The word for apples in the nominative form is \"Apple,\" in the accusative form is \"Zapple,\" and in the genitive form is \"Izapple.\"\n\n2. FACTS TO LOOK UP\n- None specified. All necessary information appears to be provided in the request.\n\n3. FACTS TO DERIVE\n- The correct arrangement of the sentence \"I like apples\" in Tizin given the verb-object-subject structure and the specific verb usage.\n\n4. EDUCATED GUESSES\n- None needed, as all information needed for the translation is provided.\n\n\nHere is the plan to follow as best as possible:\n\n- We have all the required information to translate \"I like apples\" to Tizin.\n- The sentence structure in Tizin is Verb-Object-Subject.\n- The verb in the present tense is \"Maktay.\"\n- \"I\" as the subject in the nominative form is \"Pa.\"\n- \"Apples\" as the direct object in the accusative form is \"Zapple.\"\n\nPlan:\n1. Construct the sentence by placing the verb \"Maktay\" first.\n2. Follow the verb with the direct object \"Zapple.\"\n3. End the sentence with the subject \"Mato.\"\n\nTherefore, the resulting Tizin sentence should be:\n\"Maktay Zapple Mato\"\n\nWe achieve this entirely through the given facts and logical deduction. There is no need for any additional team members for this simple translation task.\n\n/usr/local/lib/python3.11/site-packages/autogen_magentic_one/agents/orchestrator.py:216: UserWarning: Resolved model mismatch: gpt-4o-2024-08-06 != gpt-4o-2024-05-13.
