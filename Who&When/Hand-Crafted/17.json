Ask them to perform web searches, open pages, and interact with content (e.g., clicking links, scrolling the viewport, etc., filling in form fields, etc.) It can also summarize the entire page, or answer questions based on the content of the page. It can also be asked to sleep and wait for pages to load, in cases where the pages seem to be taking a while to load.\n\n\n\nHere is an initial fact sheet to consider:\n\n1. GIVEN OR VERIFIED FACTS\n- No specific facts or figures are directly given in the request.\n\n2. FACTS TO LOOK UP\n- The location of Harkness Memorial State Park.\n- The list of eateries near Harkness Memorial State Park.\n- The operating hours, specifically for Wednesdays, of these nearby eateries.\n- Any authoritative sources that might have relevant information, such as Google Maps, Yelp, or the official websites of the eateries.\n\n3. FACTS TO DERIVE\n- The proximity of each eatery to Harkness Memorial State Park to determine the closest one.\n- Verification of whether the eateries near Harkness Memorial State Park are still open at 11pm on Wednesdays, taking into account possible exceptions or seasonal hours.\n\n4. EDUCATED GUESSES\n- There may be restaurants or fast-food chains near popular parks that have late operating hours.\n- Areas with more tourists might have eateries that stay open later.\n\n\n\nHere is the plan to follow as best as possible:\n\nHere is a short bullet-point plan for addressing the original request:\n\n1. **Identify the location of Harkness Memorial State Park:**\n   - Use WebSurfer to search for and confirm the exact address of Harkness Memorial State Park.\n\n2. **Search for nearby eateries:**\n   - Utilize WebSurfer to find a list of eateries within close proximity to Harkness Memorial State Park. This can be done using Google Maps, Yelp, or similar services.\n\n3. **Filter eateries by operating hours:**\n   - Use WebSurfer to check the operating hours of the nearby eateries, focusing on whether they are open until at least 11pm on Wednesdays.\n\n4. **Determine the closest eatery:**\n   - From the list of eateries that are open until 11pm, identify the closest one to Harkness Memorial State Park based on distance.\n\n5. **Summarize findings:**\n   - Compile the results and provide the information on the closest eatery that is open at 11pm on Wednesdays.\n\nI will now proceed with these steps, primarily using the WebSurfer for web searches and information collection.\n\n/usr/local/lib/python3.11/site-packages/autogen_magentic_one/agents/orchestrator.py:216: UserWarning: Resolved model mismatch: gpt-4o-2024-08-06 != gpt-4o-2024-05-13.
