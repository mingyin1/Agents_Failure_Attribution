Ask them to perform web searches, open pages, and interact with content (e.g., clicking links, scrolling the viewport, etc., filling in form fields, etc.) It can also summarize the entire page, or answer questions based on the content of the page. It can also be asked to sleep and wait for pages to load, in cases where the pages seem to be taking a while to load.\n\n\n\nHere is an initial fact sheet to consider:\n\n1. GIVEN OR VERIFIED FACTS\n- The request involves supermarkets within 2 blocks of Lincoln Park in Chicago.\n- The supermarkets should have ready-to-eat salads for under $15.\n\n2. FACTS TO LOOK UP\n- The exact boundaries of Lincoln Park in Chicago to determine the area within 2 blocks.\n- A list of supermarkets located within 2 blocks of Lincoln Park.\n- The prices of ready-to-eat salads at those supermarkets.\n\n3. FACTS TO DERIVE\n- Calculation of 2 blocks distance from the boundaries of Lincoln Park.\n- Determining which supermarkets fall within that specific area.\n\n4. EDUCATED GUESSES\n- Common chain supermarkets such as Whole Foods, Trader Joe's, Mariano's, or Jewel-Osco might be within the specified area and are likely to offer ready-to-eat salads.\n- Ready-to-eat salads at these supermarkets are typically priced under $15.\n\n\nHere is the plan to follow as best as possible:\n\nHere's a proposed short bullet-point plan for addressing the original request:\n\n1. **Determine the boundaries of Lincoln Park**:\n   - Use WebSurfer to gather the exact geographic boundaries of Lincoln Park in Chicago.\n\n2. **Identify supermarkets within 2 blocks of Lincoln Park**:\n   - Use WebSurfer to search for a list of supermarkets located within a 2-block radius of Lincoln Park.\n   \n3. **Verify the availability and prices of ready-to-eat salads**:\n   - Use WebSurfer to check the websites of the identified supermarkets or online grocery delivery services to verify if they offer ready-to-eat salads priced under $15.\n\n4. **Compile and present the findings**:\n   - Summarize the findings including the names and addresses of the supermarkets that offer ready-to-eat salads for under $15 within 2 blocks of Lincoln Park.\n\nBased on this plan, WebSurfer will be our primary agent to gather necessary information from the web.",
