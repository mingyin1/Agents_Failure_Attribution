Ask them to perform web searches, open pages, and interact with content (e.g., clicking links, scrolling the viewport, etc., filling in form fields, etc.) It can also summarize the entire page, or answer questions based on the content of the page. It can also be asked to sleep and wait for pages to load, in cases where the pages seem to be taking a while to load.\n\n\n\nHere is an initial fact sheet to consider:\n\n### 1. GIVEN OR VERIFIED FACTS\n- The request is about an OpenCV contributor to the version where support for the Mask-RCNN model was added.\n- The name of this contributor, when transliterated to the Latin alphabet, matches that of a former Chinese head of government.\n\n### 2. FACTS TO LOOK UP\n- The specific version of OpenCV where support for the Mask-RCNN model was added.\n- The list of contributors to that specific version of OpenCV.\n- A comprehensive list of former heads of government (premiers) of China and their transliterated names in the Latin alphabet.\n\n### 3. FACTS TO DERIVE\n- The matching between the names of OpenCV contributors and the names of former Chinese heads of government.\n\n### 4. EDUCATED GUESSES\n- Based on common knowledge, some of the well-known former Chinese heads of government might include names like Zhou Enlai, Li Peng, Zhu Rongji, and Wen Jiabao.\n\n\nHere is the plan to follow as best as possible:\n\n### Plan to Address the Request\n\n1. **Identify the OpenCV Version with Mask-RCNN Support**:\n    - **WebSurfer**: Search online to find the specific version of OpenCV that added support for the Mask-RCNN model. Note the version number.\n\n2. **Identify Contributors to the Specific OpenCV Version**:\n    - **WebSurfer**: Look up the list of contributors for the identified OpenCV version. This can often be found on GitHub under the release notes or commit history.\n\n3. **List of Former Chinese Heads of Government**:\n    - **WebSurfer**: Search for a comprehensive list of former Chinese heads of government (premiers) and obtain their names transliterated to the Latin alphabet.\n\n4. **Match Names**:\n    - **Assistant**: Compare the list of OpenCV contributors with the list of former Chinese heads of government to find a matching name.\n\n### Team Member Assignments\n- **WebSurfer** will handle steps 1, 2, and 3.\n- **Assistant** will handle step 4.\n\nLet's start with step 1 by having WebSurfer identify the OpenCV version that added support for the Mask-RCNN model.\n\n/usr/local/lib/python3.11/site-packages/autogen_magentic_one/agents/orchestrator.py:216: UserWarning: Resolved model mismatch: gpt-4o-2024-08-06 != gpt-4o-2024-05-13.
