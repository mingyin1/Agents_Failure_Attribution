Ask them to perform web searches, open pages, and interact with content (e.g., clicking links, scrolling the viewport, etc., filling in form fields, etc.) It can also summarize the entire page, or answer questions based on the content of the page. It can also be asked to sleep and wait for pages to load, in cases where the pages seem to be taking a while to load.\n\n\n\nHere is an initial fact sheet to consider:\n\nUpdated Fact Sheet:\n\n1. GIVEN OR VERIFIED FACTS\n- None verified as of yet.\n\n2. FACTS TO LOOK UP\n- The year Apple stock first went above $50, using Google Finance or another credible financial resource.\n- Historical stock prices for Apple from credible sources such as Yahoo Finance, MacroTrends, or Nasdaq.\n\n3. FACTS TO DERIVE\n- None.\n\n4. EDUCATED GUESSES\n- Based on general knowledge and historical trends, the Apple stock may have crossed the $50 mark during the early 2000s, possibly around the time of the first iPod release in 2001 or the iPhone release in 2007. Another potential period is the late 2000s preceding or following the launch of significant products.\n- It's also plausible that the stock exceeded $50 in the period following the 2008 financial crisis recovery, as technology stocks saw significant growth during this period.\n\n\nHere is the plan to follow as best as possible:\n\n### Root Cause of the Failure:\nThe primary issue in the last run was the delay or difficulty in navigating and retrieving specific historical stock data on Yahoo Finance. This might have been due to slow page loading times or inefficient navigation through past records.\n\n### New Plan:\n1. **Initial Search and Resource Identification:**\n   - Request WebSurfer to identify another credible source focusing on historical stock data for Apple.\n   - Search for the first year Apple stock went above $50 (unadjusted for splits) using a direct search query.\n\n2. **Utilize Multiple Resources:**\n   - If web browsing on Yahoo Finance becomes challenging, pivot to using other resources for historical stock data such as Nasdaq, MacroTrends, or Google Finance.\n\n3. **Direct Query Execution:**\n   - Use WebSurfer to search directly within these platforms for the specific financial milestone related to Apple's stock price.\n\n4. **Filter Date Range:**\n   - Avoid possible navigation issues by directly filtering the date range to focus on potential early milestones (2000s to 2010s).\n\n5. **Verify and Cross-Reference Data:**\n   - Once the information is retrieved, verify the year by cross-referencing multiple platforms to ensure accuracy.\n\n### Steps:\n- WebSurfer:\n  - Execute a detailed search for the specific year Apple stock surpassed $50.\n  - Use alternative financial websites if primary ones fail to swiftly provide information.\n- Summarize findings and cross-reference to ensure accuracy.\n- Report back with verified year and source details.",

Ask them to perform web searches, open pages, and interact with content (e.g., clicking links, scrolling the viewport, etc., filling in form fields, etc.) It can also summarize the entire page, or answer questions based on the content of the page. It can also be asked to sleep and wait for pages to load, in cases where the pages seem to be taking a while to load.\n\n\n\nHere is an initial fact sheet to consider:\n\nUpdated Fact Sheet:\n\n1. GIVEN OR VERIFIED FACTS\n- The historical stock prices for Apple are being thoroughly investigated using credible sources such as Yahoo Finance, MacroTrends, and Nasdaq.\n\n2. FACTS TO LOOK UP\n- The specific year Apple stock first went above $50 without adjusting for stock splits.\n- Continuation of checking detailed historical stock prices for Apple on Yahoo Finance and other sources to pinpoint the exact year.\n\n3. FACTS TO DERIVE\n- Correlation between significant product launches by Apple and its stock price trajectory to understand market impacts better.\n\n4. EDUCATED GUESSES\n- Considering historical data trends observed, it is plausible that Apple stock first crossed the $50 mark (unadjusted for splits) around the mid-2000s. \n    - Specifically, given the growth momentum seen from product launches such as the iPod (2001) and iPhone (2007), and significant revenue milestones achieved during these periods.\n    - Furthermore, Apple's stock price rose sharply post-2008 financial crisis due to the overall tech market boom, suggesting it could have surpassed $50 around this timeframe.\n\n---\n\n### Next Steps:\n- Continue navigating through Yahoo Finance's historical data to identify the exact year.\n- Explore any accessible MacroTrends data more extensively or pivot to credible secondary resources if needed.\n\n\nHere is the plan to follow as best as possible:\n\n### Root Cause of the Failure\n- **Web Navigation and Scrolling Issues:** The delay and need for multiple page scrolls to locate the relevant historical data on both Yahoo Finance and MacroTrends.\n- **Time-Consuming Manual Data Extraction:** The manual approach to finding specific historical stock prices was time-consuming and inefficient.\n- **Web Page Load Timeouts:** Occasional timeouts while navigating pages.\n\n### New Plan\n1. **Initial Search Refinement:**\n   - Start with efficient, targeted searches using specific terms such as \"year Apple stock first exceeded $50 unadjusted\" to identify precised information.\n\n2. **Leverage Filter Options:**\n   - Utilize search filters on Yahoo Finance to narrow down the specific date range (e.g., mid-2000s to 2010) to minimize the scrolling and manual data extraction.\n\n3. **Sequential Data Review:**\n   - If precise search proves inefficient, break down the review period into smaller chunks (e.g., 2000-2005, 2005-2010) to systematically approach the data.\n\n4. **Secondary Source Verification:**\n   - Verify the findings from Yahoo Finance with data from other sources such as MacroTrends and Nasdaq to ensure accuracy.\n\n### Steps\n1. **WebSurfer:** \n   - Conduct a search query with refined terms to try and find a direct answer now using multiple relevant keywords.\n   - Navigate to Yahoo Finance to locate the historical data filter options, focusing on a narrowed date range initially (2000-2010).\n   - Analyze and identify the first instance where Apple stock exceeds $50 without adjusting for stock splits.\n   - If Yahoo Finance proves inefficient, move to MacroTrends or Nasdaq for similar date filtering and data analysis.\n\n2. **Assistant & WebSurfer Workflow:**\n   - Summarize and cross-reference findings from multiple sources once the specific year is identified to ensure data accuracy.\n\n3. **Fallback Approaches:**\n   - In case of continuous web navigation issues, consider asking WebSurfer to use simpler web resources with pre-compiled historical data or summaries of stock prices over periods known to have significant milestones for Apple stock prices.\n\nBy breaking down the search into more manageable parts and leveraging built-in filter options, the tasks should be performed more efficiently, avoiding repeated delays and timeouts.",

(Nasdaq: AAPL) has one of the most compelling stories in Silicon Valley. Its return from near-death in the late 1990s under the leadership of tech icon Steve Jobs is the stuff of legend.\n\nCupertino, Calif.-based Apple had humble beginnings. Jobs sold his Volkswagen AG (OTCMKTS ADR: VLKAY) van and partner Steve Wozniak sold his programmable calculator to raise $1,350, and Jobs also took out a three-month, $5,000 loan.\n\nThat was enough capital to fulfill the company's first order for 50 Apple I computers at $500 each.\n\nSince then, the company has gone from a market leader to irrelevance to the dominant tech titan it is today. And AAPL shareholders have been along for the ride.\n\nThrough its resurgence, Apple has become much, much bigger than it ever was in the 1980s. It pulls in almost unthinkable profits, earning more net income in a quarter than most companies make in revenue.\n\nThe introduction of the iPhone was the turning point. In the decade following the iPhone's debut, Apple stock soared 724%.\n\nAnd the deeper you go into Apple stock history, the crazier the numbers get.\n\n\"Some Kind of Fruit Company\"\n\nCookie Policy\n\nCookies Settings\n\nReject All\n\nAccept All\n<Image>",

Dan Taylor.\n\nIn the movie it's revealed that Lt. Dan had invested a portion of the profits from the Bubba Gump Shrimp Company in \"some kind of fruit company.\"\n\nBack in 2019 Cult of Mac took a stab at figuring out just how much the pair's stake in Apple would be worth. They had to make an assumption for the initial amount invested, which they pegged at $100,000.\n\nAnd since the letter in the movie was dated 1975 - five years before the IPO - it's assumed that the sum was invested as venture capital.\n\nAs of the Apple IPO in 1980, they'd have owned 1,476,460 shares - worth a cool $43 million after the first day of trading.\n\nBut as of August 31, 2020, after the fifth Apple stock split, Gump and Lt. Dan would have owned 330,727,040 shares valued at about $42.68 billion. That's assuming they never sold any along the way, of course. Not a bad return on a $100,000 investment.\n\nNow here's the full Apple stock history timeline...\n\nAn Apple Stock History Timeline: The 1980s\n\nDec. 12, 1980: The IPO\n\nApple sold 4.6 million shares to public. AAPL stock was priced at $22 a share for its IPO. Because of the five stock splits (as of 2020) the adjusted IPO price is just $0.10 (that's a direct comparison to the current AAPL stock price). By the end of the first day, shares had soared 32% to $29 (or $0.13, split-adjusted).\n\nBy clicking \"Accept All Cookies,\" you agree to the storing of cookies on your device to enhance site navigation, analyze site usage, and assist in our marketing efforts.

Dan Taylor.\n\nIn the movie it\u2019s revealed that Lt. Dan had invested a portion of the profits from the Bubba Gump Shrimp Company in \"some kind of fruit company.\"\n\nBack in 2019 Cult of Mac took a stab at figuring out just how much the pair\u2019s stake in Apple would be worth. They had to make an assumption for the initial amount invested, which they pegged at $100,000.\n\nAnd since the letter in the movie was dated 1975 - five years before the IPO - it\u2019s assumed that the sum was invested as venture capital.\n\nAs of the Apple IPO in 1980, they\u2019d have owned 1,476,460 shares - worth a cool $43 million after the first day of trading.\n\nBut as of August 31, 2020, after the fifth Apple stock split, Gump and Lt. Dan would have owned 330,727,040 shares valued at about $42.68 billion. That\u2019s assuming they never sold any along the way, of course. Not a bad return on a $100,000 investment.\n\nNow here\u2019s the full Apple stock history timeline...\n\nAn Apple Stock History Timeline: The 1980s\n\nDec. 12, 1980: The IPO\n\nApple sold 4.6 million shares to public. AAPL stock was priced at $22 a share for its IPO. Because of the five stock splits (as of 2020) the adjusted IPO price is just $0.10 (that\u2019s a direct comparison to the current AAPL stock price). By the end of the first day, shares had soared 32% to $29 (or $0.13, split-adjusted).\n\nJan. 28, 1984: The Mac Debuts\n\nPrivacy - Terms\n<Image>",

            "content": "New plan:\n\nWe are working to address the following user request:\n\nAccording to Google Finance, when was the first year the Apple stock went above $50 (without adjusting for stock split)?\n\n\nTo answer this request we have assembled the following team:\n\nAssistant: A helpful and general-purpose AI assistant that has strong language skills, Python skills, and Linux command line skills.\nComputerTerminal: A computer terminal that performs no other action than running Python scripts (provided to it quoted in ```python code blocks), or sh shell scripts (provided to it quoted in ```sh code blocks)\nFileSurfer: An agent that can handle local files.\nWebSurfer: A helpful assistant with access to a web browser. Ask them to perform web searches, open pages, and interact with content (e.g., clicking links, scrolling the viewport, etc., filling in form fields, etc.) It can also summarize the entire page, or answer questions based on the content of the page. It can also be asked to sleep and wait for pages to load, in cases where the pages seem to be taking a while to load.\n\n\n\nHere is an initial fact sheet to consider:\n\nUpdated Fact Sheet:\n\n1. GIVEN OR VERIFIED FACTS\n- The historical stock prices for Apple are being thoroughly investigated using credible sources such as Yahoo Finance, MacroTrends, and Nasdaq.\n- The Money Morning article discussed Apple's stock splits and general stock price milestones but did not provide the specific unadjusted price information directly.\n- As of the Apple IPO in 1980, the stock price started at $22 before any splits.\n\n2. FACTS TO LOOK UP\n- The specific year Apple stock first went above $50 without adjusting for stock splits.\n- Continuation of checking detailed historical stock prices for Apple on Yahoo Finance, MacroTrends, and Nasdaq to pinpoint the exact year.\n- Verify and cross-reference mentioned product launch correlations with stock price milestones within these platforms.\n\n3. FACTS TO DERIVE\n- Correlation between significant product launches by Apple and its stock price trajectory to understand market impacts better.\n- Impact of significant economic events, such as the 2008 financial crisis, on Apple's stock price to narrow down the timeframes.\n\n4. EDUCATED GUESSES\n- Considering historical data trends observed, it is plausible that Apple stock first crossed the $50 mark (unadjusted for splits) around the early to mid-2000s.\n    - Specifically, given the growth momentum seen from product launches such as the iPod (2001) and iPhone (2007), and significant revenue milestones achieved during these periods.\n    - The Money Morning article mentioned that Apple\u2019s significant milestones included a surge following the iPhone launch, with Apple stock soaring by 724% in the decade after 2007.\n    - The Apple stock price had significant growth, especially post-2008 financial crisis due to the overall tech market boom, suggesting it might have surpassed the $50 mark around this timeframe. This time window is roughly between 2005 and 2010.\n\n---\n\n### Next Steps:\n- Continue navigating through Yahoo Finance's historical data to identify the exact year.\n- Explore any accessible MacroTrends data more extensively or pivot to credible secondary resources if needed.\n- Utilize available filter options within these financial data platforms to narrow down the search range efficiently.\n- Confirm findings through multiple reputable sources to ensure data accuracy.\n\n\nHere is the plan to follow as best as possible:\n\nRoot Cause of the Failure:\n- **Inefficient Navigation:** The process of finding the specific year Apple stock exceeded $50 using the current web navigation approach proved time-consuming and yielded no concrete result.\n- **Incomplete Data Extraction:** Even comprehensive timeline studies didn't provide direct or specific information pertinent to the unadjusted stock price crossing $50.\n- **Overreliance on Single Sources:** Relying mainly on a single type of source or page without adequate cross-referencing or using more targeted data-driven approaches.\n\n### New Plan:\n1. **Refined Search Approach:**\n   - **WebSurfer:** Perform a targeted search using specific combinations of terms related to historical Apple stock prices unadjusted for splits. Use site-specific searches to access historical data sections directly.\n\n2. **Specific Platform Focus:**\n   - **WebSurfer:** Focus on detailed financial history sites like MacroTrends, Yahoo Finance, or Nasdaq with specific date filtering to narrow down the period between 2005-2010.\n   - Utilize any charting tools available on these platforms to isolate the year Apple stock first exceeded the $50 mark unadjusted.\n\n3. **Systematic Review and Filtering:**\n   - **WebSurfer:** Use built-in date filters on financial data sites to view historical stock prices month-by-month or year-by-year.\n   - **Assistant:** Guide WebSurfer in identifying relevant chart points if chart tools are not straightforward.\n   - **ComputerTerminal Tool:** If available data can be downloaded as CSV, parse through historical data using simple scripts to identify the specific date when stock prices exceeded $50.\n\n4. **Cross-verification:**\n   - **WebSurfer:** Cross-reference the findings from one source (e.g., a specific year found on MacroTrends) with at least one other reputable source like Yahoo Finance.\n   - **Assistant:** Construct logical conclusions based on cross-verified data rather than suppositions or broad trends.\n\n5. **Fallback Plans:**\n   - In cases where standard web search and filtering methodologies fail, consider requesting WebSurfer to analyze FAQ sections or community Q&As for probable years.\n   - Use less conventional resources if mainstream financial databases do not yield concrete results. For instance, historical news articles archived which discuss significant stock milestones.\n\nBy focusing searches smarterly within specific date ranges and using advanced filtering options, the task breakdown ensures effective navigation through the historical data, while providing clear cross-verification to guarantee accuracy.",
