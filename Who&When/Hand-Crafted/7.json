            "content": "Initial plan:\n\nWe are working to address the following user request:\n\nIn the video https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L1vXCYZAYYM, what is the highest number of bird species to be on camera simultaneously?\n\n\nTo answer this request we have assembled the following team:\n\nAssistant: A helpful and general-purpose AI assistant that has strong language skills, Python skills, and Linux command line skills.\nComputerTerminal: A computer terminal that performs no other action than running Python scripts (provided to it quoted in ```python code blocks), or sh shell scripts (provided to it quoted in ```sh code blocks)\nFileSurfer: An agent that can handle local files.\nWebSurfer: A helpful assistant with access to a web browser. Ask them to perform web searches, open pages, and interact with content (e.g., clicking links, scrolling the viewport, etc., filling in form fields, etc.) It can also summarize the entire page, or answer questions based on the content of the page. It can also be asked to sleep and wait for pages to load, in cases where the pages seem to be taking a while to load.\n\n\n\nHere is an initial fact sheet to consider:\n\n1. GIVEN OR VERIFIED FACTS\n    - The request refers to a specific YouTube video with the URL: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L1vXCYZAYYM.\n    - The task is to identify the highest number of bird species seen on camera simultaneously.\n\n2. FACTS TO LOOK UP\n    - The specific content of the video, particularly scenes where multiple bird species are on camera at the same time.\n    - Identification of different bird species that appear in those scenes.\n\n3. FACTS TO DERIVE\n    - The highest number of different bird species visible at the same time during the video.\n\n4. EDUCATED GUESSES\n    - Based on previous knowledge, it could be estimated that identifying bird species might involve looking at distinctive features such as color, size, beak shape, and behavior.\n\n\n\nHere is the plan to follow as best as possible:\n\nHere is a short bullet-point plan to address the original request:\n\n1. **WebSurfer's Task:**\n   - Open and view the YouTube video at the given URL: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L1vXCYZAYYM.\n   - Scan through the video and identify timestamps where multiple bird species are present on camera simultaneously.\n   - Take screenshots of these timestamps for reference.\n\n2. **Assistant's Task:**\n   - Review the screenshots provided by WebSurfer to identify and list different bird species visible in each scene.\n   - Count the number of different bird species in each scene to determine the highest number of species visible simultaneously.\n\n3. **Final Verification and Reporting:**\n   - Compile the findings from the tasks.\n   - Verify the highest number of bird species on camera simultaneously and report the result.\n\nLet's start with the first task for WebSurfer to scan through the video.\n\n/usr/local/lib/python3.11/site-packages/autogen_magentic_one/agents/orchestrator.py:216: UserWarning: Resolved model mismatch: gpt-4o-2024-08-06 != gpt-4o-2024-05-13.
