Ask them to perform web searches, open pages, and interact with content (e.g., clicking links, scrolling the viewport, etc., filling in form fields, etc.) It can also summarize the entire page, or answer questions based on the content of the page. It can also be asked to sleep and wait for pages to load, in cases where the pages seem to be taking a while to load.\n\n\n\nHere is an initial fact sheet to consider:\n\n1. GIVEN OR VERIFIED FACTS\n   - As of August 2023, there is only one winner of the US version of Survivor who was born in the month of May.\n   \n2. FACTS TO LOOK UP\n   - The birthdates of all US Survivor winners.\n   - Verification that there is only one Survivor winner born in the month of May.\n   \n3. FACTS TO DERIVE\n   - Comparison of birthdates to identify which specific Survivor winner was born in May.\n   \n4. EDUCATED GUESSES\n   - None at this time; specific birthdates and confirmation details are needed for accuracy.\n\n\nHere is the plan to follow as best as possible:\n\nHere is a short bullet-point plan to address the original request:\n\n1. Ask WebSurfer to search for a list of all winners of the US version of Survivor.\n2. Ask WebSurfer to find the birthdates of each winner.\n3. Identify the winner(s) born in the month of May.\n4. Verify if the identified winner is the only one born in May as of August 2023.\n5. Confirm the final answer based on the findings.\n\nWould you like me to begin executing this plan?\n\n/usr/local/lib/python3.11/site-packages/autogen_magentic_one/agents/orchestrator.py:216: UserWarning: Resolved model mismatch: gpt-4o-2024-08-06 != gpt-4o-2024-05-13.

Ask them to perform web searches, open pages, and interact with content (e.g., clicking links, scrolling the viewport, etc., filling in form fields, etc.) It can also summarize the entire page, or answer questions based on the content of the page. It can also be asked to sleep and wait for pages to load, in cases where the pages seem to be taking a while to load.\n\n\n\nHere is an initial fact sheet to consider:\n\nHere is the updated fact sheet:\n\n1. GIVEN OR VERIFIED FACTS\n   - As of August 2023, there is only one winner of the US version of Survivor who was born in the month of May.\n\n2. FACTS TO LOOK UP\n   - The birthdates of all US Survivor winners.\n   - Verification that there is only one Survivor winner born in the month of May.\n   - The complete list of US Survivor winners from 2000 to 2023.\n\n3. FACTS TO DERIVE\n   - Comparison of birthdates to identify which specific Survivor winner was born in May.\n\n4. EDUCATED GUESSES\n   - Ethan Zohn may be the winner born in May since he is a notable contestant and it was mentioned in some resources that his birthdate falls in this month.\n   - Continue focusing on credible sources like GoldDerby and Sportskeeda to gather accurate information. These pages contain substantial information on Survivor winners but require further detailed exploration.\n\n\nHere is the plan to follow as best as possible:\n\n### Analysis of What Went Wrong\n1. **Timeout Errors**: Several attempts to load pages resulted in timeouts, preventing data extraction.\n2. **Repeated Attempts on Same Pages**: Continuously trying similar search results didn't yield the required information.\n\n### New Plan with Adjustments\n1. **Initial Preparation**\n   - **Assistant**: Summarize previous findings to avoid redundant steps.\n\n2. **Target Reliable and Different Sources**\n   - **WebSurfer**:\n     - Search for non-browsed sites like Wikipedia or official Survivor fan pages.\n     - Identify credible news sites like EW.com, Survivor Wiki, or other reality TV dedicated pages.\n\n3. **Efficient Browsing and Data Extraction**\n   - **WebSurfer**:\n     - Visit dedicated Wikipedia pages or Survivor Wiki pages which might have consolidated lists and birthdates.\n     - Summarize per visited site to ensure non-duplication of efforts.\n     \n4. **Verification and Cross-Checking**\n   - **Assistant**: Cross-reference names and birthdates from different sources.\n   - **ComputerTerminal**: If we gather a list of winners and birthdates but need programmatic comparison, use simple scripts for validation.\n\n5. **Final Confirmation**\n   - **Assistant**: Compile all information to identify the winner born in May and confirm that there is only one.\n\n### Execution Strategy\n- **Assistant**: Summarize existing findings for clarity.\n- **WebSurfer**:\n  - Search distinct credible sources for comprehensive lists and birthdates of Survivor winners.\n  - Extract data and cross-reference from sources like Survivor Wiki or Entertainment Weekly.\n  - Focus on targeted terms like \"birthdates of Survivor winners list Wikipedia\" or \"Survivor winners' birthdays\".\n\nWould you like to proceed with this updated plan?",

It can also be asked to sleep and wait for pages to load, in cases where the pages seem to be taking a while to load.\n\n\n\nHere is an initial fact sheet to consider:\n\nHere is the updated fact sheet:\n\n### Updated Fact Sheet:\n\n1. **GIVEN OR VERIFIED FACTS**\n   - As of August 2023, there is only one winner of the US version of Survivor who was born in the month of May.\n\n2. **FACTS TO LOOK UP**\n   - The birthdates of all US Survivor winners.\n   - Verification that there is only one Survivor winner born in the month of May.\n   - The complete list of US Survivor winners from 2000 to 2023.\n\n3. **FACTS TO DERIVE**\n   - Comparison of birthdates to identify which specific Survivor winner was born in May.\n\n4. **EDUCATED GUESSES**\n   - Ethan Zohn may be the winner born in May since he is a notable contestant and it was mentioned in some resources that his birthdate falls in this month.\n   - Focus on credible sources such as Wikipedia, which often consolidates comprehensive historical data on TV series and their contestants.\n   - Cross-reference information from Survivor fan pages or databases, which frequently keep detailed records on contestant histories and birthdates.\n\n### Plan:\n\n1. **Initial Preparation**\n   - Consolidate existing findings to avoid redundant steps.\n\n2. **Target Reliable Sources**\n   - Check Wikipedia for the list of Survivor winners and their birthdates.\n   - Use GoldDerby, Survivor Wiki, and other credible news sites for further verification.\n\n3. **Extract and Verify Data**\n   - Extract birthdate information from these sources.\n   - Verify and cross-reference extracted data.\n\n4. **Final Confirmation**\n   - Compile all information to conclusively identify the winner born in May and confirm the uniqueness of this finding.\n\n\nHere is the plan to follow as best as possible:\n\n### Analysis of What Went Wrong\n- The browsing process faced repeated timeouts and could not load the necessary information pages reliably.\n- The information collected was insufficient to determine the birthdates of all US Survivor winners.\n- Existing retrieved web pages didn't fully load or did not contain the required details.\n\n### New Plan\n1. **Retry Reliable Sources with a Timeout Buffer**:\n    - **WebSurfer**: Visit the Wikipedia page for US Survivor winners and search for birthdates.\n    - Avoid previously unreliable sites and focus on stable and comprehensive sources.\n\n2. **Extract and Verify Data from Web Sources**:\n    - **WebSurfer**: Load the Wikipedia page [List of Survivor (American TV series) winners](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Survivor_(American_TV_series)_winners).\n    - Summarize data accurately and cross-reference with other available sources like GoldDerby and Survivor Wiki.\n\n3. **Summarize and Present Results**:\n    - **Assistant** and **ComputerTerminal**: Use any additional data extraction tools or scripts to refine and verify the collected information.\n    - Ensure all details are cross-verified before presenting the final result.\n\n4. **Final Confirmation**:\n    - Compile a list and conclusively identify the US Survivor winner born in May.\n    - Present and verify no duplication of results.\n\nWould you like to proceed with this plan?",

The American series premiered on May 31, 2000, on **CBS**. It is hosted by **Jeff Probst**, who is also an **executive producer** along with **Mark Burnett** and the original creator, **Parsons**.\n\n**Survivor** places a group of people in an isolated location, where they must provide food, fire, and shelter for themselves. The contestants compete in challenges including testing the contestants' physical abilities like running and swimming or their mental abilities like puzzles and endurance challenges for rewards and **immunity** from elimination. The contestants are progressively eliminated from the game as they are voted out by their fellow contestants until only two or three remain. At that point, the contestants who were eliminated vote for the winner. They are given the title of \"Sole Survivor\" and are awarded the grand prize of $1,000,000 ($2,000,000 in **Winners at War**).\n\nThe American version has been very successful. From the **2000\u201301** through the **2005\u201306** television seasons, its first 11 seasons (competitions) rated among the top 10 most-watched shows. It is commonly considered the leader of American reality TV because it was the first **highly rated** and profitable reality show on broadcast television in the U.S., and is considered one of the best shows of the 2000s (decade). The series has been nominated for 63 **Emmy Awards**, including winning for Outstanding Sound Mixing in 2001, Outstanding Special Class Program in 2002, and was subsequently nominated four times for **Outstanding Reality-Competition Program** when the category was introduced in 2003. Probst won the award for **Outstanding Host for a Reality or Reality-Competition Program** four consecutive times from 2008 to 2011. In 2007, the series was included in Time magazine's list of the 100 greatest TV shows of all time. In 2013, TV Guide ranked it at No. 39 on its list of the \"60 Best Series of All Time\".

Sixteen or more players, split between two or more \"tribes\", are taken to a remote isolated location (usually in a tropical climate) and are forced to live off the land with meager supplies for 39 days (42 in The Australian Outback, 26 in post-COVID seasons). Frequent physical and mental challenges are used to pit the teams against each other for rewards, such as food or luxuries, or for \"immunity\", forcing the other tribe to attend \"Tribal Council\", where they must vote off one of their tribemates.\n\nSignaling the halfway point in the game, survivors from both tribes come together to live as one, making it to the \"merge\". At this point, survivors will compete against each other to win individual immunity; winning immunity prevents that player from being voted out at Tribal Council. Most players that are voted out after the merge form the game\u2019s \"jury\". Once the group gets down to two or three people, a Final Tribal Council is held where the remaining players plead their case to the jury members. The jury then votes for which player should be considered the \"Sole Survivor\" and win the show\u2019s grand prize. In all seasons for the United States version (excluding Survivor: Winners at War whose winner won $2 million), this has included a $1-million prize in addition to the Sole Survivor title; some seasons (particularly earlier seasons) have included additional prizes offered during the game, such as a car, as well as fan-favorite prizes awarded at the finale. All contestants are paid on a sliding scale based on the order they were voted out: the first player voted out has been given US$2,500 and the amount increases from there. Some of the seasons that have featured returning players have increased these amounts: Survivor: All-Stars featured payouts starting at US$5,000, while Winners at War had a minimum US$25,000 payout. All players are offered US$10,000 for participating in the finale show.\n<Image>",

Premiering on May 31, 2000, on CBS, it is hosted by Jeff Probst, who also serves as an executive producer. The show places contestants in remote locations where they must survive with limited resources and compete in various physical and mental challenges to win rewards and immunity from elimination. Contestants are progressively voted out by their peers until a final jury chooses the \"Sole Survivor,\" who receives a grand prize of $1 million, though some seasons have offered additional prizes.\n\n\"Survivor\" has been highly successful, with its first eleven seasons consistently ranking among the top 10 most-watched shows in the U.S. It has garnered significant acclaim, being nominated for 63 Emmy Awards and winning several, including four consecutive awards for Outstanding Host for Jeff Probst. The series is praised for its influential role in the reality TV genre, and it continues to air on CBS, with the 47th season set to premiere in February 2025. Over the years, the show has introduced various twists to keep the format fresh and challenging for its contestants.",

            "content": "New plan:\n\nWe are working to address the following user request:\n\nAs of August 2023, who is the only winner of the US version of Survivor to be born in the month of May?\n\n\nTo answer this request we have assembled the following team:\n\nAssistant: A helpful and general-purpose AI assistant that has strong language skills, Python skills, and Linux command line skills.\nComputerTerminal: A computer terminal that performs no other action than running Python scripts (provided to it quoted in ```python code blocks), or sh shell scripts (provided to it quoted in ```sh code blocks)\nFileSurfer: An agent that can handle local files.\nWebSurfer: A helpful assistant with access to a web browser. Ask them to perform web searches, open pages, and interact with content (e.g., clicking links, scrolling the viewport, etc., filling in form fields, etc.) It can also summarize the entire page, or answer questions based on the content of the page. It can also be asked to sleep and wait for pages to load, in cases where the pages seem to be taking a while to load.\n\n\n\nHere is an initial fact sheet to consider:\n\n### Updated Fact Sheet:\n\n1. **GIVEN OR VERIFIED FACTS**\n   - As of August 2023, there is only one winner of the US version of Survivor who was born in the month of May.\n\n2. **FACTS TO LOOK UP**\n   - The birthdates of all US Survivor winners.\n   - Confirmation that there is only one Survivor winner born in the month of May.\n   - The complete list of US Survivor winners from 2000 to 2023.\n\n3. **FACTS TO DERIVE**\n   - Comparison of birthdates to identify which specific Survivor winner was born in May.\n\n4. **EDUCATED GUESSES**\n   - **New Guess**: Richard Hatch might be another potential candidate, as the initial years of the series had older contestants who might align with the less looked-up data.\n   - **Updated Guess**: Ethan Zohn remained a notable contestant, with a higher chance based on speculated resources suggesting his birth in May.\n   - Focus on credible sources such as Wikipedia, GoldDerby, and Survivor fan pages/databases, which regularly maintain comprehensive content on contestants' histories and birthdates.\n\n### Plan:\n\n1. **Initial Consolidation**\n   - Review existing findings to avoid repeating steps.\n\n2. **Targeting Reliable Sources**\n   - Use Wikipedia, especially for structured lists of Survivor winners with birthdates.\n   - Refer to GoldDerby, Survivor Wiki, and other reputable data sources for further verification.\n\n3. **Extracting and Verifying Data**\n   - Gather birthdate information from the identified sources.\n   - Cross-check and verify extracted data for accuracy.\n\n4. **Final Confirmation**\n   - Combine verified information to conclusively determine the winner born in May and validate the uniqueness of the finding.\n\nWould you like to proceed with the updated plan based on the revised fact sheet?\n\n\nHere is the plan to follow as best as possible:\n\n### Analysis of What Went Wrong\n- The previous attempts faced issues with accessing and loading complete and reliable information from various web sources.\n- The specific section of Wikipedia listing the birthdates for winners wasn't reached or accurately summarized.\n- Repeated attempts led to wastes of resources and redundant searches without extracting the needed specific birthdates.\n\n### New Plan\n1. **Definitive Search and Navigation**:\n   - **WebSurfer**: Directly navigate to a known reliable source (like Wikipedia or Survivor Wiki) specific to the list of Survivor winners.\n   - Use precise search terms such as \"List of Survivor winners birthdates\" and focus on established fan sites and lists.\n\n2. **Identification and Summarization**:\n   - **WebSurfer**: Open the Wikipedia or Survivor Wiki page listing winners and their birthdates. Extract the needed data.\n   - Summarize the birthdates in a clear format to identify the winner born in May.\n\n3. **Cross-Verification**:\n   - **WebSurfer**: Open additional reputable sources like GoldDerby or other Survivor-dedicated platforms to cross-verify the birthdate extracted.\n\n4. **Final Confirmation**:\n   - **Assistant**: Compile summarized lists and verify that only one winner's birthdate falls in May.\n\n5. **Error Contingency**:\n   - Have a backup plan to retry different sources if the primary search fails again. Avoid sources that have timed out or failed in prior attempts.\n\nWould you like to proceed with this new plan?",

Hosted by Jeff Probst since the very beginning, it is credited by many as starting the reality show craze that has been a major part of TV this century. After being on the air for two decades, 20 of the most iconic champions returned in Season 40\u2019s \u201cWinners at War\u201d to compete in the first-ever all-winners season. Following a temporary delay due to Covid-19, the reality TV show continued with even more twists and turns for the \u201cNew Era\u201d in 2021, which included more diversity amongst its cast members. Tour our updated Survivor winners list gallery below that highlights everyone from Richard Hatch to the most recent.\n\nUPDATED: Dec. 18, 2024\n\nSeason 1: Richard Hatch\nSurvivor: Borneo\n<Image>",
